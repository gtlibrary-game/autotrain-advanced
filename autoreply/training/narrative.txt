Chapter 6: A Light Tap	
	For no man lives without guilt. To do so is to live as a plant or animal.
—From The Living Book of the Dead

“You should have told Censor Magic you saw his friend’s ghost,” Non said as they entered the street. “That would have thrown him.” Robles chuckled. Soon they were back at the glass shop, and before their talk of Censor Magic forced Tomrin to yell at them to stop. 
Inside Godly Glassworks, the noon heat had not yet penetrated the front. Fredick—with Rennly nowhere to be seen—sat at the desk area along the wall near Master Lazoloth’s office. Tomrin glanced away from Fredick to Laz’s door. It stood ajar. The master was out for lunch himself. Tiff and Ken had also left. 
“Let’s see about getting the Scarab working,” Tomrin said, turning to Non and Robles. 
Robles punched Non’s shoulder. “We can check on the lenses.” The two of them left for the back, leaving Tomrin to begin piecing the Scarab back together. Non and Robles returned before Lazoloth did. The three of them were taking turns looking through the Scarab when the old man stepped inside the glass shop. 
“Big Laz,” Robles called to the gray-haired Peregrine man. “Check it out.”
For a moment Master Lazoloth looked older than death itself and as he shambled over he seemed as if the weight of the world rested on his shoulders. As he drew closer, his eyes lit on the Scarab and he brightened. “I see you put it back together, but what is this? This lens is all rough.” 
“It needs grinding and polishing, but—” Tomrin tried to say.
“Just look,” Robles interrupted. “It is still a prototype.”
Master Lazoloth bent down and put his eye to the Scarab’s objective. “Interesting,” he said, bending up. “The achromatism is gone.”
“Amazing isn’t it?” Robles asked.
“Amazing. Yes? The ramifications? What could they be? Coherent light…? Hmm…?” Master Lazoloth mused to himself then patted Tomrin on the shoulder. “Even the fools at the Sapphire Front will have to see what we have here.” He headed for the door of his office, a welcome spring in his step. 
“The ramifications...” Robles said, as if trying to ponder them himself.
“Can we count all the golden ducks?” Non asked. “Those are the ramifications I care about.”
Tomrin pulled the doublet out of the armature. “This isn’t just about money,” he said. “We are changing the world. That is ramification enough for me.” Master Laz often spoke of the ramifications of their work, but in truth, Tomrin rarely understood half of what he was saying. “Non, this one is yours. Polish it,” he added, keeping focused. If they started talking about money nothing would get done.
Non slowly took the lens from Tomrin’s hand. “Fine.”
Non and Robles left Tomrin sitting at his workstation. He tried to think straight but his head buzzed with thoughts of Rennly, Gaz, Laz, and the Scarab. They tumbled over each other in his head. Finally, he stood and headed into the back room. The hot air in the back didn’t help and he retreated to the front of the shop. 
Fredick with his hands stuffed down the front of his pants inspected the Scarab. Tomrin walked over. “We need to talk,” Tomrin said.
Fredick glanced up and raised an eyebrow. “This doesn’t look like what—” 
Tomrin poked a hand in Fredick’s face and touched Fredick’s forehead with the tip of his index finger. “Listen to me,” he said as he pushed his finger against Fredick’s forehead. “You are not to touch the Scarab. I told you this.” Tomrin pulled his finger away from Fredick’s face and waited for him to respond, to acknowledge that he heard, that he understood. Fredick said nothing, but turned and headed to his own work area.
Sweat cooled Tomrin’s hands but his legs boiled in his pants and his face burned like he had fallen into a glass furnace headfirst. Breathing heavily through his nose, he sat down at his bench and absently arranged his tools, not making the bench any less cluttered. He just rearranged the shape of the mess. He sighed several times, then stood up and headed through the double doors to the back where it was hotter. At least the heat made sense, with the furnaces for the different colored glass leaking heat into the air. The crew of mostly Peregrine, their ruddy faces extra red from the heat, ignored him as they worked the colored glass.
He watched Non grind a tool for the new lenses. “Robles is outside,” Non said. 
“Thanks,” Tomrin said, but he headed for the front again.
Fredick sat at his sidewall desk. Master Lazoloth stood nearby in his office doorway. “Tomrin,” the old man said. “Can you come in a minute?” 
Tomrin’s walked over and Master Lazoloth held his office door open for him. He could feel Fredick’s eyes on his back, but refused to look at him. Instead he marched inside Master Laz’s office feeling awkward. “Fredick, come in too,” Master Laz said. He shut the office door behind them both.
A pressure built in Tomrin’s skull. Master Lazoloth sat as he and Fredick stood in front of the man’s desk, waiting for him to speak. Master Laz rested his tired hands on a stack of scattered design papers. “Fredick tells me you hit him.” 
“What?” Tomrin said, glancing at Fredick. The boy wore no expression on his face. “No. I didn’t hit you.” 
“You did,” Fredick said primly. His eyes flashed and he pointed to his forehead. “You hit me right here.” 
“I touched you. I didn’t hit you.” 
“So you did touch him?” Master Lazoloth asked. 
“I touched his forehead. Is that what this is about?” 
“You hit me and you should be fired.” 
Tomrin scoffed. “Big Laz, I touched him. I asked him to use his brain. He’s not supposed to touch the Scarab without my say so. He knows that.” 
“You are not my boss,” Fredick said.
“Yes, you’re right, Fredick,” Master Lazoloth said. “I am, and I don’t want you touching the Scarab either. We’re at a critical juncture now.” 
Fredick drew himself up. “He assaulted me, Master Lazoloth,” he said. 
Tomrin didn’t like the sound of what he was hearing. “What the feathers? Assault?” 
“Calm you yourself, Tomrin—and Fredick,” Master Laz said. “Both of you. Calm.”
“I will not calm myself,” Fredick said. “First you stop paying me, and now you let this insect abuse me. I know you have money in the vaults at the First Farmers Bank? You think I’m stupid?” He reached into his pocket and flashed a scrap of paper before jamming it back into his pants pocket.
“I have no idea what that is,” Master Lazoloth said.
“What money?” Tomrin wasn’t sure what he was hearing. “I thought payroll was late for everyone, because we need the Sapphire Front to pay us.”
“Yes. Yes. Fredick, next week,” Lazoloth said.
Fredick began waving his other hand around like a loon. “You two are in this together! I know it. You are stealing from the rest of us!” 
“No,” Tomrin said, arching away from Fredick’s errant finger-wagging.
“Calm down, Fredick!” Master Lazoloth said, all but shouting himself. 
“First you rob us, now you do nothing while this bug assaults me!” Fredick turned and marched out of the office, opening the door open so hard it slammed against his workstation. He shouted as he rummaged through his stuff on his bench. “Big Laz is robbing us blind! And I won’t stand for it! I’m taking this theft to the constabulary! There are laws! Even in Corundum!” 
Tomrin’s hand went involuntarily to his front right pocket where he kept his papers. His billfold wasn’t there. Master Lazoloth began saying something. “I can’t believe I hired Fredick.  Nothing but a feathered—” Master Lazoloth stopped mid sentence. “Tomrin? What is it?”
“I forgot my papers. They are in my other pants.” Sweat leaked from every pore on his neck and head.
Master Laz’s own face grew ashen as his Peregrine complexion lost several shades of red as he fished his own billfold out. He opened his wallet and sighed. He looked up. “You better go get them. We can talk when you return. I think I have figured out the ramifications.” 
“The ramifications?” Tomrin said.
“If we make things small enough—” Master Lazoloth said. “No. But go. We can’t have you in jail over nothing.”
Tomrin blinked. Things? Small? For a split second, he thought he could see what Master Lazoloth meant about the ramifications. An ephemeral image appeared in his mind, complex, colorful, and flashing. It was so intricate that he could hardly focus on a single aspect of it as it shifted and disappeared. 
He wanted the vision back but Master Laz was right; he needed his papers. “Feathers, I’ll be back,” he swore and headed for the door. 
As Tomrin exited the glass shop he swore again. The feathered law was silly, but as a freed Peregrine without his papers he taunted fate as surely as anything—doubly so with the Leviathan’s Mark growing on his chest. “Feathered feathers!” He hurried down the street.🔖


Chapter 7: Officer Stabtus
Once you taste the ambrosia, you will realize that you and it are one.
—From The Living Book of the Dead

Tomrin ran, disbelieving he could be so foolish as to forget his papers. The green glow and the specter of Gaz had distracted him, but still! To forget his papers? “Feathers!” The lamb chop in his belly sloshed in the low-spirit tarsk he’d drank at lunch and the afternoon’s hot air gusted against his face as his head swam from the heat. He worried he might fall over if he kept up his current pace. You’re free! You’re free!
As he caught his breath, he tried to think what he would say if a constable did stop him and demanded proof he was who he claimed to be.  It took no brains to run a billy club. I don’t even have a penny to bribe him. The idea of being tossed in jail for the night because he didn’t have his papers angered him now. And it scared him.
At the Winged Helm Inn, he turned up the highway and swore under his breath at Fredick—and at the system. He felt himself going to the dark place where his anger and fear turned to madness, to the place where the evil growing in his chest beneath the Leviathan’s Mark called to him. There was no reason he had to be the emperor’s slave. None he could see.
He had read the tracts. Emperor Jarvis had acted creatively in setting the Orish and Peregrine free. His tax rules were that cleverness. But, by the rules of The Book of Light—and enforced by the Daughters of Heaven’s Glory and their censors—none of the lesser races were allowed to be anything but slaves. Tomrin was convinced his own father had transferred his ownership to the emperor because Dable Watersipper would be feathered if he was going to pay that kind of money, one golden ducat per slave.
Back home and inside his room, his clothes were gone. “Mistress Fallon!” he shouted. “My papers!” 
“Don’t yell in my house!” she called back from the washroom. From the doorway she emerged disheveled. Her fleshy pink Rubish arms and hands were dripping wet. Blinking, she wiped her forehead. “I bet you are looking for your wallet. I found it in your green pants.” 
“Where?” he asked.
“On the kitchen table.” She followed him forward. “Your papers were in there too.” Tomrin grabbed his billfold. His patents were safe inside. “You could wind up in real trouble,” Mistress Fallon said. “I thought you knew you had to keep those on you? And the money?”
“Not now,” Tomrin said as he stuffed the bondworks inside and refolded the leather wallet and jammed it into his pants, tapping it through the fabric. He hadn’t noticed his wallet missing earlier at lunch because Non had paid. “I have to go,” he said, ignoring her question. 
“You shouldn’t be carrying that much money,” Mistress Fallon said. “What if you had been robbed.”
Her tone and pawing around in his billfold irritated him. “As I’ve told you, I’ve been busy. And now I have to go.”
“I know I told you week-to-week,” Mistress Fallon said.
Tomrin walked around her and to the front door. “Yes, I heard you.”
“Maybe if we bumped the monthly rent up a touch—maybe then I could let you stay month-to-month.”
“We will talk later,” Tomrin said, and opened the door. He stepped back out into the heat and hurried up the street.
Back out front of Godly Glassworks, the glass Seasargus dozed like it was weary of the sun, even though the fiery sun no longer glinted off it. Stepping to the door, Tomrin’s pulled the weighted glass open and glanced up Smithy Lane to the Hall of Victory. The large blue dome quivered in the heat. Down the other way, Fredick walked beside a man in tan. The two of them strode up the street with purpose. The yellow-headed boy wasn’t bluffing about getting the authorities involved. 
Tomrin stepped inside and pulled the door closed. “Feathered Fredick!” he swore. “He’s coming.”
Members of the shop, front and back, stared at him as a single torch burnt unattended on the front bench. Robles sat nearby on a stool with Non standing at his side. Polishing rust dirtied Ken’s hands and fingers—he had more patience with polish than most. The door to Master Lazoloth’s office stood closed. At Fredick’s desk, Jan and everyone from the back milled about, whispering. 
“Yes? About Fredick?” Robles said.
“He’s coming with a constable.” 
“Then it is true?” Jan said. “Master Laz did steal the money.”
“No, it’s not true,” Tomrin said.
“Fredick is just a paranoid fool,” Robles said. “You can see it in his beady little eyes.” 
“I need this job,” one of the backroom workers, Dar, said. 
“We all need this job,” Tomrin said, but worried the constable would arrest him for assault, as silly as it sounded. “Should have stabbed Fredick,” he added, muttering to himself.
Robles pulled out his knife. “Try this. It’s sharp,” he said softly, as a shadow moved in the window.
“Put that away. They are coming.” 
Robles slipped the knife back into its sheath. “Steady now,” he said.
“Me? You are going to get us into trouble with your antics if anyone is.”
Robles scoffed as the tall door of gray and blue glass swung open strong enough to feel it shake the wooden floor as it banged against the wall. Fredick entered. A Rubish man with a large gut in a tan uniform entered right behind him. The hexagon badge on the man’s chest proclaimed him a lawman with its gemstone design worked in silver. At his hip rode a tan nightstick. He enforced the emperor’s laws, just as the censors enforced the gods’. 
“You Master Lazoloth?” the man said, blinking at Tomrin. Sweat dripped down his flushed pink Rubish face.
“No, not him,” Fredick said. He marched over to Master Lazoloth’s door and yanked it open. “This is the thief!”
Master Lazoloth stood up and calmly walked to the doorway. “Is there some problem, Constable—?” 
“Officer of the Crown, Dhom Stabtus,” the Rubish man said. “And I am afraid a credible accusation has been made per your character.”
“My character? Really?”
“And as one of the emperor’s bondsmen it can not be ignored.” 
“What are you saying, Officer Dhom?” Master Laz asked. 
The constables’ hands went to his belt and he hitched his pants before pulling out a pair of manacles which hid under his belly. “I mean… I’m afraid you will have to come with me.”
Master Lazoloth stepped from his office. “Freely.” He nodded at the cuffs in the constable’s hands. “Those won’t be necessary.” 
“Put your hands out,” Constable Dhom commanded. “I’m afraid it’s required in instances like this.” The man glanced around the room. Almost pleading, he added: “You all understand.” 
Master Lazoloth raised his arms in front of himself and waited as Stabtus fastened and adjusted the manacles. “Too tight,” Lazoloth said. 
“That’s how they are,” Status replied stoutly. He put his hands on Lazoloth’s upper arm and led him to the door. 
“One moment.” Master Lazoloth turned. “You are fired, Fredick. I don’t want to see you here again.” 
Fredick grinned his smarmiest grin. “Like I care to work for nothing.” 
“Alright,” Status said. “You can worry about all that later. For now, your accuser has to come with us.” 
“What about us?” Jan demanded. She was the back forewoman. 
“You a witness?” Stabtus asked.
“Yes, it’s everyone’s money he stole.” 
“I didn’t steal anything,” Master Laz said in a voice pinched as if trying to hide the pain he was in. 
Tomrin wanted to shout at Jan and Fredick—at everyone. What is wrong with you? But he said nothing. He worried Fredick might remember his accusations of assault. 
“That will all be worked out at the courthouse,” Stabtus said. “I don’t want any trouble, you hear? And don’t think about trying to bribe me.” He shot a look at Fredick, then led Lazoloth outside.
 Fredick stepped behind him and the door closed. The backhalfers all started talking at once. Robles tossed his knife at the wall. Chunth! Silence fell over everyone. “Now that I have your attention,” Robles said. He glanced at Tomrin. “I’m sure Founder Tomrin has something to tell you all.”
Tomrin blinked at him, wondering why his friend was having a go. “Um. The court will clear Master Laz,” he said. “Don’t worry. The glass shop will stay open.”
“I was thinking more that we needed to go down there and support him as a group,” Robles said. “As his loyal employees.”
“I was thinking how nice it would be not having to deal with Fredick anymore,” Non said. “Never should have hired him.”
“I think we all wish to know what is really going on here,” Jan said as she gave Non a hairy eyeball. She marched herself and the backhalfers to the front door and outside.
Tomrin snuffed the gas torch and turned to Robles. “You think Fredick was stirring up trouble with them?”
“Did you really hit him?” Non asked. 
“No. I barely touched him.” 
“This isn’t your fault,” Robles said. “This is on Fredick and maybe Rennly.” 
“I think Fredick felt slighted by your promotion,” Ken said. Tiff nodded. 
“I don’t know.” Robles sounded skeptical. 
“But you hit him, Tomrin?” Non said. “Then he exploded.” 
“No, I don’t think that is it,” Robles said as he walked to the front door.
Tomrin followed. “Kind of smells like Rennly to me.”
“It kind of does,” Robles allowed softly.
“You forgot your pack, Robles?” Non said. “Or are you afraid to bring it to the courthouse?”
“Censor Magic it over to me,” Robles said. Non picked up and made to toss the pack. “That means bring it to me,” Robles added hastily.
Non scoffed. “That’s boring magic.”
The shop’s traitors were well ahead of them on Smithy Lane by the time Robles herded Tomrin, Non, Ken and Tiff out the door. More than half the shop had turned on Master Laz and now the terrible pressure in Tomrin’s skull from before built again. He feared he was about to explode like the initial effluence of a torch. “Let’s keep our distance.”
“Why?” Robles asked, shooting him a rare frown. 
 “They aren’t true glassers, like us,” Non offered.
 Ken grunted noncommittally. Tiff asked what they could expect next.
“Less mouths to feed,” Non said. 
“I hope you like working in the back then,” Tomrin countered. 
Non groaned. “I was hoping to take over Fredick’s job. And now that the Scarab works, you’ll have time yourself.” 
“There is always more to be done on the Scarab,” Tomrin said. “Until it’s perfectly perfect.”
At the bottom of the valley, the road shot straight towards the center of town to the temple. The Hall of Justice sat a block away under its watchful eye. The doves which cooed so freely in the eaves of buildings earlier nested quietly now. The heat of the courthouse bricks boiled Tomrin’s eyes in his head.
Inside, the floors needed polishing. Years of foot traffic had turned the marble to soapstone. A dirty light filtered down muted brown through the skylights. Tall wooden doors with bronze plaques lined the building. The wooden benches on the walls held women with small children, not all Peregrine or Orish. A Rubish mother nursed a half-breed Peregrine child. Workmen, perhaps in the midst of rows with their neighbor, stood glumly staring at doors now closed to them. 
On a stone bench a man sat, his sword hilt jutting out. The hedge lords of the surrounding farms had to seek their justice in the courts now, just like everyone else. The right to wear swords, however, was still afforded them. The Emperor’s Restoration had changed many things, but not all.
Farther down in the hallway near the slave courts, the press of humanity was inhuman. Curse words flew freely. Orish and Peregrine alike bantered coarsely—men and women alike. It almost reminded Tomrin of being home at the festival. I don’t want to go home! Heading home meant he would have to burn the scales tonight, not tomorrow. Feathered, Gaz! Why did you have to die?
Stabtus led Master Lazoloth to the slave court’s doors. Jan and her group stood huddled on the far wall eyeing them. The slave courts ran with surprising efficiency. When one Rubish sued another, their trial could last years. Slaves however were not afforded such process. Unfair maybe, but Tomrin was glad that this would all be over soon, then he could get back to work and away from the grating noise and thick musk of Orish men.
A tattooed one stepped in front of the constable. “I’ve been here for all feathered day,” the man said, loudly. “Why in Seasargus’ Black Beak is this man going first?” 
“Get out of my way and wait your turn,” Officer Dhom said, pushing the man almost twice his size to the side. “Judge Reydal calls you when he calls you.” Stabtus opened the door and waved Fredick and Master Lazoloth inside. “The rest of you wait here.” 
“What about witnesses for the defense?” Tomrin asked.
“You want to testify on the embezzler’s behalf?” 
“No, on Master Lazoloth’s behalf. He’s not an embezzler.” 
“Fine, whatever...but just you.” 
Tomrin glanced at a grinning Robles. “We trust you,” Robles said. But Non’s face contorted and Tiff squeezed Ken’s hands. 
“Go on,” Stabtus said and Tomrin stepped through the door thinking it would be better to have Robles go instead. His friend had a way with words, and with people. And Robles was at least Orioles. 
The presiding judge, also Orioles, wore a red robe and sat on the high dais near the front of the room, not too high on his throne to look a Serath in the eyes, but high enough for petitioners to bend their necks to meet his gaze. A large brazen plaque on his desk proclaimed him one Jeremy Reydal, Esquire. The gray in his dark hair said he was old enough to be Tomrin’s father. The silver wings at his temples made him look more dignified than any man had the right, as if the robes weren’t enough. Yet, somehow, he looked familiar. 
He was hammering his gavel and shouting for order to be restored. Tomrin hadn’t heard what had caused the uproar, but from the back of the room men and women jeered with disdain. The place was mayhem save for one small island of serenity, a dark skinned Adaman woman. Her bright blue eyes pierced Tomrin and for a second he wondered if she had done something to make the wound on his chest itch. 
“Councilor Marten!” The judge shouted. “Restrain your charge or I will have him restrained.” 
“Yes, your honor,” a large man—even for an Orish one—answered from the banister. The wooden bar separated the judge, recorder, and bailiff from the unwashed masses.
The Orish counselor, the one which had answered to the name Marten, tucked a massive arm around the head and neck of his Orish charge. Dragging the man’s head to his mouth he spoke in the man’s similarly upswept ear. The man tried to resist, but under the lawyer’s brown vest, muscles flexed and buckled, quelling the man. “Listen!” Marten hissed loud enough for the court to hear. Cut in the western style of Zircos, the large man’s brown vest would not look out of place there—save for the man was an Orish slave.🔖


Chapter 8: The Gamblers Union
Because we desperately need to it rhyme, 
So shall it be written in the annals of time.
—Last line and verse of The Gambler’s Pledge

A man with a golden sword standing near the door began taking wagers, bets on the outcome of the case. The local gentry were bored indeed.
“Your Honor, Judge Reydal,” Dhom Stabtus said over the descending quiet. “I have a case of a freesoul versus a bondsman. A priority case.” 
“Are you feathered serious?” the unruly Orish defendant said.
“Well, I think I have heard enough,” the judge said and slammed his gavel back down. He pointed the wooden thing at the man. “Guilty. Councilor Marten, I find your client guilty. Master Flager, owes the Master Cordwine two silvers. Now get out of my courtroom room before I hear another word! Bailiffs!” 
“Thank you, Your Honor,” the Peregrine councilor for the prosecution said over the cacophony of the bailiffs removing the losing side of the argument. 
“So what is this case?” Judge Reydal asked once order was restored and the guilty and innocent parties had left the room—and the bets paid out in another round of loud whispers.
“A case of embezzled funds, your Honor. This, Master Lazoloth, here is accused of stealing money from the common fund of the company they work at, Godly Glassworks by Fredick Kistabal here.” 
“Well, take off his shackles, Dhom,” Judge Reydal said. “No one is to appear in my court in chains if they don’t have to. You know the rules.” Stabtus undid the manacles and marched back outside the courtroom.
Tomrin tried to smile at Master Lazoloth, but feared all he did was frown. Glancing away, his eyes lit on the court recorder. Tomrin tried not to stare. She was the singing girl from the Winged Helm Inn. While she had smiled then, now she had a severity to her—like she took this job far too seriously. And the judge? Was he the same man with her? In his red silk judge’s gown he looked quite different. 
Tomrin pulled his eyes from the girl, but found himself glancing instead at the Adaman woman. His eyes glided over everyone else save the large Orish counselor. 
Under the threat of the judge’s gavel, the court finally grew silent. The prosecuting lawyer stated the charges against Master Lazoloth and Judge Reydal handed Big Laz over to the losing lawyer. “Counselor Marten,” he asked. “Does your client understand the charges against him?” 
Marten did not even look at Master Laz. “Yes, your Honor.” 
“Then how does he plead?”
“Not guilty.”
“Very well,” the judge drawled as if he’d said the same so many times he’d lost count. “The court will hear the evidence.” He turned his attention to the Peregrine lawyer conferring with Fredick. “Councilor Divertay, evidence? Arguments? For the the court please.” The man raised a finger and continued to nod his head at Fredick. “Today, Counselor?” 
“Yes, Judge Reydal,” counselor Divertay said, turning his head towards the judges’ high desk. “The accused—”
“Master Lazoloth,” Counselor Marten injected as the man with the gold sword began to whisper.
Divertay swatted a hand as if at a fly. “Master Lazoloth here refuses to pay his employees despite having the money in the bank,” he continued. “This is theft and he must pay them their rightful due. To do otherwise is stealing.” 
“I’m not a thief,” Master Lazoloth said loudly. The judge raised an eyebrow at him, and Counselor Marten put a hand on his shoulder and whispered something in his ear.
“Farmers First Bank,” Master Lazoloth said aloud. 
“And?” the judge said. 
“I ask the court that Master Lazoloth’s accounts be subpoenaed without delay,” Counselor Marten said. “Farmers First Bank.” 
“Counselor Divertay?” the judge said. “Will the prosecution stand by those records as proof of guilt or innocence?” 
Divertay glanced at Fredick. The blond-headed boy nodded. “Yes, your Honor.”
“And you, Master Lazoloth?” The judge asked. 
“Yes,” Laz’s lawyer answered for him. “But, we would like to reserve the right to call witnesses.” 
“Naturally,” the judge said. 
“As would we.” 
The judge glanced at Divertay. “So someone has seen the man commit this theft? Is that what I am hearing.”
“No, your honor. Not to my knowledge.” 
“No, I thought not. But, you are well within your rights, I suppose.” The judge then directed one of his bailiffs to go to Farmers First Bank and to return with the ledgers of interest. “And don’t delay. This should be open and shut. The next order of business?” he said, turning to the girl furiously writing at her own smaller desk below his. “There is still much to do while the sun still shines.”
The gambler continued his whispering as the girl flipped through her notebook. “You could call up...” Before she could bring up a name from the list—a list Tomrin guessed she had been compiling all day—and before the bailiff could exit the door, Marten objected. 
“I’m sorry, your Honor, but I would like to suggest a brief recess. Certain, important security concerns presented by the case…” The counselor glanced from the Adaman woman at the back to the judge. “And what they might pose to the Crystal Throne.” The Orish man added, sounding a bit confused himself.
The judge frowned. “What considerations?” 
“They are of a nature, Judge, that we would not like to disclose them in open court—not without reviewing them with you first.” 
“Irregular, Counselor.” The judge glanced at Divertay and Fredick. “But without objections I am obliged to grant everyone a recess. Counselor Divertay?”
Divertay glanced up from his whispered discussion with Fredick. “No objections, your honor.” 
“Granted.” The judge slammed his gavel down. “We are in recess.” He stood up and walked to the door behind his chair. 
The remaining bailiffs began to clear the courtroom as Marten ushered Master Lazoloth through the bar towards the front. Fredick and Divertay followed them out. Lastly followed the court recorder. Tomrin’s eyes tracked her unconsciously. Her gray dress was cut high enough to be modest but not too low to be staid. It flattered her slim Orioles figure. I’m married to my work, Tomrin reminded himself when a bailiff instructed him to leave as well.
Outside the courtroom, Robles wanted to know everything that was going on inside. 
“It was strange,” Tomrin said, searching the crowd for the Adaman woman. Somehow she had managed to disappear. 
“What was?”
“The lawyer knew about our work with the Sapphire Front…I think.” Tomrin suspected the redheaded woman with the bronze skin and blue eyes, but he didn’t know how to explain her part in the matter. “That’s all I can figure.” 
“Master Lazoloth must have told him?” 
“I don’t know. Fredick and his lawyer were chatting like crazy, but Master Laz said barely a word to his.” 
“Sort of sudden like,” Non said. 
“It was sudden...” Tomrin thought to add more, but his eyes followed Robles and Non’s glazes to the courtroom door. The door stood open and the court recorder stepped into the hallway. 
“Uhh,” Non moaned.
“Remember, I saw her first,” Robles whispered. 
The girl’s eyes lit on Tomrin and she walked over. “Founder Tomrin Watersipper?” she said, sounding a bit surprised herself at the words coming from her mouth.
“Yes,” Tomrin said. “I’m—uh— Tomrin.”
“And a Founder,” Robles added. “But it sounds more official when you say it.”
“That is because it is official,” the girl said, not turning her big brown, and no-nonsense eyes on Robles, but keeping them firmly locked on Tomrin. “Counselor Marten has requested you.” She turned around and beckoned him over her shoulder with a freckled  finger. “This way, please.” 
She led Tomrin back into the courtroom. The bailiff at the door let her through with only a cursory glance. Straight away, he and the girl passed through the banister to the front of the room and headed for the small door the counselors had left though. 
Tomrin read the much smaller nameplate on her deck. “Elisah Reydal?” 
“Yes?” she said curtly. 
“You’re related to the judge?” 
“He is my father.” 
“Why do you think the counselor wants to see me?” The ideas of Fredick pressing more charges filled Tomrin with a touch of dread.
“I didn’t think to ask and he didn’t think to tell me,” Eliash said. “It’s not my life to know such things.” She led him out into the hallway and down a long aisle of leather bound law books. Ladders reached up to the highest ones. Such wasted effort on such uselessness. No doubt half the books dealt with owning and punishing slaves.
Elisah stopped and knocked on a door. A muffled call came from the other side. “Come in.” She turned the doorknob and ushered Tomrin inside. 
“Thank you, Recorder Reydal,” the large Orish counselor said. Elisah nodded and shut the door without a word. The man held out a hand towards Tomrin. “Come. Sit.”
Two large chairs flanked the man, but he motioned to a smaller one across the table. 
Tomrin walked to the solitary chair. “Where is Lazoloth?” he asked as he sat. “You know he is innocent, right?” 
“Of course he is,” the lawyer said. “And call me Marten. That’s what they always called me in the army: Emerald Front. I fought during the Restoration.” 
“Thank you for that,” Tomrin said, “But—uh—?” 
“But why did I want to see you?” 
“Yes, I suppose that, and um—” Tomrin glanced around. “Where is Master Laz?” 
“He is patiently awaiting the account books,” Marten said, folding his massive hands on the table. “This little meeting is not about that  exactly. I have someone here who wishes to speak to you.” Marten’s eye roved over to a small door in the wall in the corner of the room. He was not a small man and the chair groaned as he stood up. Even though he wore a vest like a skinny man for Zircos, he was anything but skinny. Regardless, he moved with a dancer’s grace and he acted far more intelligent than most Orish men his size. When he opened the far door, the tall Adaman woman from the courtroom stepped out of a shadowy adjoining room. 
“Lady Margretta,” Marten said. “Tomrin Watersipper—as you well know.”
“Hello,” Tomrin said. It was more of a question than anything. How did this woman know him? He had stared at her almost the whole time and now she was here, and knew of him without even sparing him a glance.
Her dress swished as she entered the room. She waited until she was on the other side of the table before she said a thing. Speaking to Marten she thanked him. Turning to Tomrin she said: “Hello, Master Watersipper. It is nice to see you again.” Tomrin had risen from his chair and she motioned for him to sit. “But imagine my surprise seeing you here…today?” She was pure business, folding her bronze hands in front of herself on the table on Marten’s right. 
“I don’t remember you?” Tomrin said, wondering how she knew him. Perhaps she was sent by someone in the Saphire Front—or even the Emerald Front. Spies and spies with spies. It was the way of the army. Tomrin had learned as much at the Hall of Victory.
“Marten and I are not often in town,” the dark skinned woman said. “Marten more than I.”
Tomrin glanced at the big man. “You came to our attention some time back.” the large man said.
Margretta held up a hand to silence him and continued. “We look for someone much like yourself, someone with talents—your talents.” The tone she took did not make Tomrin think she meant his talents with glass and his scalp began to buzz.
“I—ah—don’t know if I’m looking for new employment. But, I am—uh—a loyal subject of the Empire,” he added.
“You have many talents, Tomrin. Of that I am convinced. Remember Lord Southerly’s farm?”
“Spy glasses then?” Tomrin said. 
“Opera glasses was what I was told, and ostensibly that is all you were led to believe as well?”
“Everything is connected,” Tomrin said. “I was working on opera glasses but that was just the line we were fed by the kind of people who answer to Lord Southerly.” Living there was the first time Tomrin had removed the scales from his chest. It had not gone well and he spent several days in the infirmary from a fever he caught after the cut became infected.
Lady Margretta slowly unfolded her fingers and continued. “This goes beyond spying,” she said as Tomrin stared at her hands, the color of her skin was lighter on her palms—similar to that of Robles’.
Tomrin glanced over to Marten. “I don’t know anything about anything else,” he said. “I’m only good with glass. I worked in my father’s carpentry shop, but I was never any good.” Marten cocked his head slightly to the left and Margretta grunted. The two of them clearly disbelieved every word.
 “Let’s talk about what I can offer,” Margretta said.
Tomrin hemmed softly to himself and waited, hoping she had nothing he wanted, because he was beginning to worry the woman might be referring not to just any old skill. He only needed the slightest excuse and this interview was over.
“First I can end the proceedings against your Master Lazoloth straight away. I can clear him in Jarvis’ name,” she said. She held up her right index finger, then reaching under the table, she returned it to the top with an ivory-colored card. Smiling like a cat with a mouse, she pushed the small rectangle forward across the table towards Tomrin.
The card held the imperial seal, the same as his own patents, a large peach. “Not bondworks?” he said.
“Something else entirely,” Margretta answered.
The peach was stamped in black ink and the card was signed in what might have well been the emperor’s own hand. Tomrin waited, then, glancing up at her and Marten he said: “But you say, there is nothing to worry about. The master will be cleared.” 
Marten folded his arms across his vest. “Well,” he said. “No one can know for sure.” 
Margretta tapped the card and frowned. “That doesn’t mean you wouldn’t be better off in my care.” 
“I am bound to the Emperor’s will—” Tomrin said. He reached out and picked up the card from the table and read the words aloud. “The bearer of this bond speaks for me, Lord of the Crystal Throne, Champion of the East, and Emperor of Corundum, Lord Jarvis Teaubril. Do as they command, and you do as I command.” He set the card back down on the table, and reached into his own pocket, but didn’t withdraw his billfold. “My papers say that I am free to disregard any master who does not sit upon the Crystal Throne itself. It too is signed by Emperor Jarvis.” 
Margretta slid her card back across the table. “It is true, you are free to disregard me. As you are not part of the hierarchy. The Emperor’s generosity sometimes tries my patience,” she muttered more to herself, than to him or Marten. “I have many talents myself, and there are things I would teach you, young Tomrin. This shop of yours, it’s running out of money. Then where will you be?”
Again, Tomrin heard hints. His neck prickled. The woman spoke like a Dark Sister hinting at darker things. I need to get out of here!🔖


Chapter 9: A New Turn of the Cycle
The first rule of power is thus: spy upon your neighbors.
—From The Living Book of the Dead

Lady Margretta made a face raising her eyebrows. “The world is a dangerous place, young man, as I’m sure you know,” she said softly. “We have taken a hands off approach until now, but with censors sniffing around, things can no longer continue as usual.”
“Censors?” Tomrin said. “Hands off? We?”
“Yes. Censors. One false move,” the woman said. “And the men who stand tall today, plummet the next.” 
“I’m not sure about that… I’m not trying to plummet,” Tomrin said. “I’m a glass man. I’m happy to work glass until the day I die.” 
“And when your master runs out of money…or is convicted?” 
“You aren’t going to force the judge?” 
“I am not here to force him,’ she said.
 Tomrin pushed out his chair. “I think I would like to leave.”
“Wait!” the woman said sharply. “You think everything is just fine, but I can tell you this: you are in a precarious spot, young man. You are more like your Master Lazoloth than you may know. Ever wonder why he never married?” 
“I’m sure he has his reasons.”
“And you?” 
“Still young.” 
“Yes, but you won’t be young forever, and yet how much time have you put into thinking about finding a wife?” 
“I’m not carefree about such things. I am married to glass.” 
“Carefree or not you are careless. Not all hidden things are fully hidden, so trust me when I tell you this. Some people can see more clearly than others. You are flying blind.”
“And by going with you to where exactly would my eyes be opened? My blindness cured?” 
The woman lowered her gaze a foot and looked right at his chest. “You would have to trust me.”
“I am not the trusting type,” Tomrin said and turned away. He walked to the door as his scaly wound itched under his shirt. “I will be right here, in Menad,” he said before opening the door. “Where I belong. I am a glassworker and nothing more. If you think I want to be something more, you are mistaken. Spying on me changes nothing.”
“I wouldn’t call it spying,” the woman said. 
Tomrin wanted to ask her just how much she knew, but was afraid he might learn she knew far too much. He had always feared what might happen if a censor or Daughter of Heaven’s Glory found him. But dealing with this creature—a Dark Sister?—she promised him a fate far worse. Women who sold their souls to the demons were pure evil. He glanced at Marten but the man acted unconcerned by her. 
“Squinting?” Margretta asked. “Maybe I can clarify a thing or two for you,” she said. “But not here, not in Menad.” 
“Not sure I need things cleared up,” Tomrin said quickly. 
“That is because you are closed—and live in shadows,” Margretta said severely. “The West is in turmoil. That strife is headed this way. Slavers and censors from Zircos have already entered Menad and they are not particular about who they stop, or who they search.”
“That’s the emperor’s fault.” 
“Perhaps I should let His Highness know that he should do more?” the lady said sardonically. 
“You have his writ.”
“That’s true, but censors move freely. Not even Jarvis can do much about them. I may have the emperor’s ear, but he is in Corundum. And that does not help against overzealous men in black. A whole slew of them entered Menad this afternoon. With slavers,” she added, smirking almost as if she were the one commanding this horde she conjured from thin air.
Sweat beaded on Tomrin’s forehead, but he refused to wipe it. “I’m a loyal subject with nothing to fear. The slavers, I leave to you, and to Jarvis.” 
“They will be dealt with legally. But slavers are nasty and brutish bunch,” she added. “And one might ask how little you go to temple? And a censor might just wonder how good of a person you truly are.” 
“If you think I’ve done something wrong, why don’t you call the censors yourself?” Tomrin said, hoping to bluff his way out of this conversation. “But for now, I think I have heard enough.” 
“And Master Lazoloth?” Margretta asked.
“What about him?” 
“Would you let him suffer a terrible fate, bankruptcy or worse, when you could stop it, just to remain in this crummy little town, always looking over your shoulders, always afraid?” 
“I’m not afraid,” Tomrin said, feeling ice in his stomach. His heart began pounding. “I’ll be going now, so please consider helping Master Lazoloth—if you can. He’s a good person.” 
“So naive,” Margretta said, shaking her head. “Be careful, Master Tomrin. You walk a terrible thin line.” She didn’t say the words: You walk the Shadow Line, but Tomrin heard them in his head. He wondered if perhaps she feared he would trip and fall into the light? He worried that himself. But also that he might slip into darkness.
“I try to do what is right. You should too,” he said.
“What is right? Our world is filled with only half-truth. And outright lies. Sometimes it is hard to know the difference between truth and lies.” 
“And right and wrong?” 
“Exactly.” 
“I don’t find it hard. You should help Master Lazoloth because he is a good person. The top is not the bottom. The left is not the right.” 
“Laugh and make light.” Margretta turned to Marten. “I told you he was a fool and a coward both.”
“I’ll just let myself out,” Tomrin said. The anger in his words sounded harsh in his ears. He didn’t want to be afraid and he didn’t want to act a fool. No one could know anything about him. Nothing! There was no way she could know, unless she was a Sister of the Dark, and he didn’t want to think about that.
He opened the door. Marten bounded over and called for Elisah.
“Done?” Elisah asked. 
Tomrin walked past the lawyer and out of the room. “Yes,” he said.
“I need to see Master Lazoloth again, Mistress Reydal,” Marten said. 
“Yes, Counselor. And I will let the bailiffs know as soon as I am done with Founder Watersipper.” 
“Actually, I will do it. You see that Founder Watersipper is taken care of.”
“Yes, Counselor.” 
“And you—” Marten turned to Tomrin. “—take care and good luck.” 
“If Master Lazoloth is innocent it shouldn’t need luck,” Tomrin said.
“Well—” 
“My father will make that determination,” Elisah said. “Come. Let’s go.” 
They walked less than twenty steps down the hallway before Rennly Rickot turned from a side hall and strode towards them. “Why’s he here?” Tomrin asked, his words buzzing in his left ear.
Elisah didn’t answer him, but raised her voice. “No one is allowed back here, Censor.”
Rennly didn’t stop but strutted forward until his badge was in her face. “I don’t know if you can see, but I am a censor.”
“Censor or not; only sworn members of the court are allowed back here,” Elisah said.
Rennly jutted a finger around her and pointed at Tomrin. “This one is on the court now?”
“He is in my custody, and if you don’t want to create an incident, Censor, I suggest you find your way out, back the way you came in.”
“Well, aren’t you feisty?”
Elisah drew in a heavy breath. “I am fully within my power to arrest you right here, and right now, Censor,” she said. “Feisty does not begin to explain my powers. In these halls… So please turn around and exit this hallway—the way you came in.”
Rennly eyed her wearily. “As long as you have this little one in hand,” he said, nodding at Tomrin. “Then I will take my leave.” He whirled around and headed back down the hall. 
Elisah scrunched up her chin and breathed heavily through her nose until Rennly disappeared through a side door. “Now,” she said, but added no more as she led Tomrin back to the courtroom and into the hallway. 
Robles and Non waited with the others. Non was busy biting a nail while Robles was confessing to him that he was the one who stole all the glasswork’s gold. “With magic!” 
Tomrin sighed. “Be serious.” 
“What did the lawyer want?” Robles countered. 
“He wanted to tell me he thought Master Laz was innocent.” 
“Took him long enough to tell you that,” Non said. 
“I know.”
“What now?” Robles asked.
“Now we wait for the bailiff to return to proceed.” 
“How’s Big Laz?” Non asked. 
“Only saw his lawyer.” 
“And the girl,” Robles pressed. “Now, what about her?”
“Elisah Reydal. She is the judges’ daughter.” 
“I knew that I knew her name,” Robles said. “I wasn’t lying about seeing her first.” 
“She is all yours,” Tomrin said, smiling to himself at the way she had told off Rennly.
The court reconvened and Tomrin reentered the courtroom. He glanced around the spectator seats, feeling watched. The lady Margretta had moved to the opposite corner in the back. She didn’t look at him but when he glanced away he felt her blue eyes boring into his sweaty back. Elisah gave him a pinched smile when she caught him looking at her. The judge began to speak. “Counselors, you’ve seen the evidence. Now I will hear the arguments from the prosecution.” He made no mention of their secret talks.
Fredick and Divertay whispered amongst themselves for several seconds. “Um, yes, Judge,” Divertay finally said aloud. “As you could see from the ledgers, there is money in the glasswork’s accounts under Master Lazoloth’s name. If he can’t afford to pay his employees, why is this money there?” 
Master Lazoloth whispered to Marten on the other side.
“Judge,” Marten said. “It seems it is the prosecution’s stance that Founder Lazoloth is stealing from his fledgling company by putting money into his accounts. But to me that seems the opposite of the charge being levied.” 
“This is a symptom, Judge,” Divertay said.
“Of what?” Judge Reydal demanded.
“Of corruption, Your Honor,” Divertay replied. “If he has money why is he hiding it? Why won’t he pay his employees?”
Through his front right pocket, Tomrin tapped his billfold with its undeposited banknotes. “How much money are we talking about?” he asked. 
Judge Reydal turned his head towards him. “This is my court, young man; I ask the questions. So who are you? And moreover, why do you want to know so badly as to interrupt?” 
Tomrin blinked as he pulled out his pocketbook. “Um. I’m—uh—also a Founder of Godly Glassworks, and I have here a couple months of pay all drawn from the Glasswork’s account—no—from Master Lazoloth account with Farmers First Bank.” He could feel all the eyes in the courtroom fall on him, not just the judge’s and Adaman woman’s. 
The judge turned to his nearest bailiff. “I want to see those,” he said, pointing at Tomrin. 
The bailiff pushed his way through the bar and Tomrin placed the small stack of banknotes in the man’s outstretched hands. The man shook his head. “This is crazy.” 
“I believe in the glassworks,” Tomrin said.
“What is going on, Chall?” Judge Reydal asked.
 The bailiff shrugged. “Nothing, Your Honor.”
“Will you bring them to me?” Irritation rang in the judge’s question.
“Yes,” Chall said, as if waking himself from a dream. “Yes, Your Honor.” 
Tomrin turned his head to see what Fredick and Divertay were thinking. Fredick stared blankly forward. Tomrin hoped this meant the blonde-headed boy knew he was losing this foolish battle. 
The bailiff handed the bills to the judge, and one-by-one Jeremy Reydal listed off the amounts. “Recorder, how much was that?”
“One moment, Your Honor,” his daughter said, all protocol.
The judge nodded when she read off the cumulative amount. “Master Lazoloth, did you know anything about this?” the judge asked, finally looking up.
Master Laz glanced at Marten. “No, Your Honor,” Master Lazoloth said. “I keep my own records. I thought that account was all but empty.” 
The judge let out a long sigh. He rubbed the flowing red sleeves of his robes over his forehead. “Counselor Divertay, has the prosecution any further arguments?” 
“Um, Your Honor—” 
“Perhaps ones that make some semblance of sense?” Jermey Reydal added. The court burst forth with hoots and he was forced to bring down his gavel. “Quiet! Feathers! Quiet! Divertay! Counselor, I asked you a question,” he continued when the court had quieted.
Divertay glanced at Fredick then back to the judge. “The prosecution has no further arguments.” 
“And you, Counselor Marten?” Judge Reydal asked. “Anything you would like to add before I rule?” 
“No, Your Honor.” 
Tomrin could hear the smile on the man’s face. He had won as he knew he would. 
“Then I am going to sum everything up,” the man in red said. “As far as I can tell Master Lazoloth has operated his glass shop with honor and dignity, and based on our sidebar it will have money soon to pay all the employees what they are owed. That there is a discrepancy is not his fault, but because one of the employees has not recently visited the bank—for whatever reason—but I can imagine out of loyalty to Master Lazoloth, perhaps something the prosecution could learn from. So it seems to me that the defense has behaved as to reflect well on his own master, Emperor Jarvis, and as such I am forced to conclude that he is in fact innocent of the crime of embezzlement. You are free to go. And, you, young man,” the judge said, pointing at Fredick. “Perhaps this has taught you something about the value of loyalty?” 
“Yes, Your Honor,” Fredick said, his voice barely audible over the buzz of the gamblers in the back.
“And you, Master Lazoloth, I would suggest you fire him.” 
“I already did.”
“Well, then, before I adjourn for the day, I would like to thank you on behalf of the Crystal Throne. You are a patriot and an inspiration.” 
“Thank you, your Honor.” 
Judge Reydal turned Fredick. “And you, please do not darken my courtroom any time soon, young man. I do not like frivolity from anyone. I can and I will find you in contempt.” 
“No, Judge,” Fredick said. “I hear you.”
The judge glanced at the skylights oozing the last of the light of day into the room. “This court is now adjourned,” he said and hammered his gavel down. Standing he handed the account book to the bailiff and Tomrin’s bank notes to his daughter. He exited to the din of his court rollicking as money changed hands, mostly with the man with the golden sword.
The judge’s daughter motioned to Tomrin and held up his bank notes. A bailiff let him through the bar and Elisah handed over the draws. “All because you couldn’t go to the bank?” she said, a wry smile on her face.
“What? No—” 
“It’s probably just as well,” she said. “Now your master knows who he can trust.” 
Tomrin slid the notes back into his billfold. “Thanks, I guess. I’ve been busy.” 
“Doing the god’s work at the shop?” she said.
“Yes, and the emperor’s,” Tomrin replied, feeling awkward. He glanced away to where Lady Margretta had been sitting. The woman’s seat sat empty. She had run off again. “Excuse me,” Tomrin added, wishing he could stay and talk with Elisah. He hurried over to shake Master Lazoloth’s hand.
Big Laz thanked him and Marten. Then he and Tomrin headed out into the hallway where everyone was waiting for Laz, save for most of the backhalfers. There was no Fredick in sight. “Those disloyal dogs are all fired,” Master Lazoloth said of those that didn’t congratulate him on his victory. “And they can go to the feathered Lake of Fire for all I care.” 
Robles laughed but Tomrin was surprised to hear the man swear, true anger in his words. 
“Now what?” Non asked when they reached the front door of the courthouse. Outside the sun hung low over the valley. 
“I need to lock the shop for the night,” Master Lazoloth said. “Then home. It’s been a day.”
“I’m already headed back up,” Tomrin said, quickly. “I need to finish up something before I can head home to Woolad tomorrow.” 
“That’s right,” Master Laz said. “You two have lost a friend.” He dug out the shops’ brass key. “I guess you can lock up tonight. Leave the key under the stone for me tomorrow?” 
“I will,” Tomrin said, taking the key. He and the others said their goodnights to Master Laz, and the old man headed for his home near the center of town. 
“Well, I think this calls for a victory drink,” Robles announced.
“I suppose it does,” Tomrin allowed. He figured a bit of high-spirit tarsk would take the edge off. “I need a strong drink—or three—after today!” 
Non and Robles soundly agreed.🔖


Chapter 10: A Leviathan’s Mark
All is not lost until the Fates have spoken.
—A Silvan saying lost to time

The selection of music throughout the week at the Winged Helm Inn’s was usually local singers, Rubish men, Peregrine songbirds, or Orish grist, the best of a hard people ground down harder, but tonight the four on the stage were all Orioles. Unlike the judges daughter Elissa, from their dress, they were from Zircos. They and the men at the bar proved Lady Margretta’s words true. High-spirit drinking slavers in vests mixed with granite faced censors in black.
Tomrin and Robles had their backs to the wall. “My aunt’s letter said they were coming,” Robles said.
Tomrin picked up his tin of high-spirit tarsk. He slammed the tin down after shooting the burning contents into his mouth and swallowing. “Ugh!” he said. “Feathers.” The slavers in a western style, their leather straps coiled at their waists brushed their neighbors when they moved, but it was the men in black silk at the bar who worried Tomrin. “We should go somewhere else.”
“It’s going to be the same everywhere,” Non said. “Worse. At least here the porters don’t take any guff.”
“You’ll just have to drink harder,” Robles said. “At least Master Lazoloth is cleared. Life will seem better with more tarsk. Plus we can all be glad we aren’t dead like Gaz.” 
Tomrin raised his second mug filled with low spirit tarsk. “To Menad. To Judge Reydal,” he said. “And to not being dead.” 
“And to the judge’s daughter,” Robles added. He raised his own mug and so did Non. They each took a drink. One of the Orioles men at the bar turned and sneered at them before turning his glare on the wider room. Free slaves were clearly bile in the man’s mouth.
“I think I am going to drink this down and head to work,” Tomrin said. He finished his other tin of low-spirit tarsk.
Robles stood. “Let me settle up,” he said and walked over to the counter with the censors and slavers. When he returned to the booth he drained his mug.
“Leaving so soon?” the doorman asked them on the way out. “Something wrong?” 
“Nothing wrong, Neem. Nothing a little scouring won’t scrub out of the stools.” 
Neem raised his eyebrows. “Oh? Yes. Well, some smells are passing.” The man was Rubish and the way he wrinkled his nose as he glanced inside, it was clear he too had little love for these Orioles invaders. “But gold is gold.” 
“Yes it is, Master Neem,” Robles said, bowing. “Good evening.” 
Neem bowed. “The same to you Master Robles, and to your friends.” 
They stepped onto the street. A distant boom echoed up the valley. Foom!  A light, red fire, burst from a house deep within Menad’s heart. The flames twisted smoke into the air, black as night. Something had exploded.
“That could be my place,” Non squealed as he started running. 
“No, it isn’t,” Tomrin said.
“It could be,” Robles said, glancing over at Tomrin. An unusual seriousness lined his friend’s face. “And Master Lazoloth’s is right there too.”
“No, Don’t try to shine me on,” Tomrin said. His stomach lurched.  “I can’t believe it.”
Robles swung his pack over his back and took off running. “I know, I know,” he said without slowing.
Tomrin’s didn’t register a thing as he ran. He wasn’t afraid. He was numb. He glided detached, his mind disembodied. It was like this was happening to someone else. A memory from his youth attacked. 
He saw Master Davit Rickot, Rennly’s father, dying, burned up in the flames as they consumed the Watersipper carpentry shop. Now any fire burning out of control... The thought of it made him uneasy. 
Smoke danced up ahead. Houses hid the flames, but the smoke glowed as it rose. The temple, several streets removed, towered up pristine white while the stores and homes on the street, wooden buildings, dry from an unseasonable spring, seemed like ready tinder.
Fire bells tolled from the firehouse, and the courthouse bells rang as the street filled with gawkers. Constables ran rope to cordon rope off the street ahead, blocking them from the burning home.
“Feathers,” Non said. “It’s not mine but it is Master Laz’s.”
“We have to go in,” Robles said, shaking Tomrin’s arm.
A constable shouted inarticulately from the line. “No through!” 
Tomrin followed Robles closely as he punched a way through the growing mass of people. “Firecrew,” Robles told the constable.
The man began to raise the rope, but stopped. “Where are your badges?” he asked. “And your gear?” 
Tomrin looked beyond the man to the burning house as two green fire trucks led by massive horses pulled up. 
“The other houses could catch fire and you are asking for your badges?” Robles said. “If that happens, Constable—” Robles folded arms then unfolded them. “That’s on you.” 
The man frowned and held up the rope. 
“You two are the firefighters,” Non said. 
Tomrin and Robles ducked under the line, leaving him and the constable behind. Tomrin waited until he and Robles were out of earshot. “I’m not firecrew,” he said. 
“I was,” Robles retorted. “That’s good enough for both of us.” The grin he shot Tomrin was a sad one. As they neared the house, the question of the wisdom of following Robles skittered across Tomrin’s brain. They weren’t supposed to be here and now they were in a mix of people, official men, constables, censors, and firecrew.
One censor was Rennly. Feathers. The itch on Tomrin’s chest screamed at him to get away, to run, to hide. “What the feather are they doing here?” he muttered. When he realized the others included Fredick and Jan. The three of them were standing with two Orioles men as they spoke with a stocky Rubish man in a green fire hat. 
“Marshal Tamerton,” Robles said, “What’s going on?”
Men jumped from the trucks. In teams of four, they began pumping water onto the blaze. Gallons of water spewed from the lines connected to the large brass pots hauled on the back of the green trucks. Two four-man teams warred with the fire. 
“Is Master Laz inside?” Tomrin asked. “Have you taken your complaints into your own hands, Fredick?” 
“He made the explosion. Not us,” Fredick said. “We were minding our own business.”
“He wouldn’t do that,” Tomrin said. “You’re talking nonsense.”
“Not unless he had something to hide,” Fredick said. 
“What does he have to hide now?” Tomrin asked. “He beat you, now your revenge is to burn his place? For making you look a fool? That’s more likely what this is.” 
Rennly scoffed. “Only firecrew should be here. I’d feel better, Marshal, if—” 
Fire shattered a lower window, cutting off his words. Lines of water shot in through the new hole as smoke boiled out. 
“Tamerton,” Robles said. “We need someone inside  right now to find Master Lazoloth.” 
The marshal glanced at Robles. “Not a good idea. I know you’d be fine but—” 
“I’m not asking you to risk your own men, Marshal.” Robles pointed to himself and Tomrin. “Us.” 
Tamerton nodded slightly. He turned and shouted. “Two coats!”
“I don’t know about this,” Tomrin said. 
“You already saved Laz once today,” Robles said. “I understand if you don’t want to save him again.” He pointed at Fredick. “It might be a good idea if you are not here when I return, especially if I’m a dead man walking.” Fredick stepped back at the vehemence of Robles’ words.
A young Rubish boy with the coats arrived.
“I don’t know the first thing about fires,” Tomrin said as he pulled on his offered coat. 
“You almost saved Rennly’s father,” Robles said and glanced around as if looking for Rennly. But Rennly and Fredick had stepped away to argue more with Tamerton who was now talking with his men.
Tomrin shrugged. “Strange things happen.” That was a statement as true as time and a fact even he could not stand to disbelieve. “I once promised myself I’d never do this again.”
“Feathers,” Robles cursed. “We can’t back out now.”
“I’m not backing out.”
Foregoing the hat offered to him, Robles pulled his own from his pack. “Good. Because we really need to save Master Laz now if we are going to.”
“Your own fire hat?” Tomrin said.
 “Never know when it might come in handy,” Robles replied as a fireman held out an ax. Robles grabbed it. “Let’s go. Master Lazoloth is waiting.” 
“I don’t know what I am doing,” Tomrin said, slouching under the weight of the coat.
“Just stay low,” Robles said. “And don’t breathe the smoke.” He attacked the door with his ax. Kathug! Kathug! 
“Don’t breathe the smoke,” Tomrin muttered to himself as he followed Robles inside, his words lost in the crackle and howl of the fire. A painting, a white stallion on the far wall at the end of the hallway wasn’t burning yet. It was the only thing not leaking smoke or fire.
Robles opened a closet. “Not here!” His voice sounded like an echo. 
The oven-like heat in the house beaded sweat on Tomrin’s forehead. The smell of smoke robbed the air of breathability. “We need to hurry,” he croaked. 
“We’re not splitting up,” Robles said. “That’s how people die!” 
“I’m just saying we need to hurry!” They were both shouting to be heard over the fire’s roar.
Robles put a heavy hand on Tomrin’s coated shoulder. “Steady, now. We’ll find him. We’ll find Master Laz. Don’t worry.”
As they headed up the flight of stairs to the second level, Tomrin began to lose hope. The smoke was thick and pushed them to their knees. It would almost certainly overmaster their efforts now as it boiled chest-high down the hallway. 
Master Lazoloth lay on the floor, the top half of his body in the hall. Blood leaked from cuts where shrapnel punctured his skin. Robles crouched over him. A dark pool had formed under the man.
A chair on the floor lay upset under Master Laz’s feet. It was as if the explosion had upended him and it both. The closet in the far wall held gas cylinders—the same as the glass shop. They lay flat stacked in the closet. A rill of red fire leaked from one nozzle.
In a flash Tomrin saw what happened. A taper on Master Laz’s reading desk had caught the drapes on fire as he had fallen asleep over a large bottle of high-spirit tarsk. The fire had burst one of the cylinders. “We should leave,” Tomrin said loudly to be heard over the flames.
“Not without Master Laz,” Robles shouted back. 
“He’s as dead as Davot  Rickot was.”
“No, he might not be,” Robles shouted. “I think I feel a pulse.”
Tomrin pulled on Robles’ shoulder and pointed at the cylinders. “We need to get out of here before they all go!” 
Robles’ understood and he mouthed the word feathers before shouting. “We take him with us! Help me!” He knelt down near Master Lazoloth’s head and reached back. “His hands!” he shouted.
Tomrin picked up the master’s arms and handed them to his friend, then like a bag of grain, Robles grabbed and hitched the old man over his shoulder. Tomrin wasn’t sure how, but his friend had a feral strength. He had the brute force of an Orish farmhand and the will of an iron prod to go with it. He stood in the smoke and staggered forward to fall, gasping for breath, but he pulled the master down the hall and down the steps. Robles then all but ran with him on his back to the front door. Only once on the street did he sag and not stand up quickly. 
Firecrew ran to him as Tomrin bent over and peeled Master Laz’s blood-slicked body off him. Tomrin shouted in Robles’ ear. “We have to get further away!” Tamerton was there with the others. Tomrin shouted at him. “Get away! Get everyone back!” In with the bottled gas there had been bottled air. If both gas and air were to go at once... “The whole block could go!” 
“Wha—?” The fire marshal tried to ask but the first explosion knocked the words from the man’s mouth. Woomph! The blast stiff armed Tomrin in the chest. The second explosion split the house. KACAHAK! Boards and timbers shot through the air above them as the entire second story disintegrated and the burning bits and shattered pieces of house began to rain down.
Robles began shouting and coughing as flaming bits sailed to other houses and to the nearby apothecary shop. “Stop the spread! Stop the spread! The whole block might go!”
The fire marshal gained his composure though he had his hands on his head, holding on his hat like a simpleton and shouting the same thing to anyone curious enough to ask for orders. “Don’t let the fire spread!”
Robles, also continued to shout, and cough and yell at everyone, even at the marshal if he stopped to question him as he and they stomped the flames and tried to snuff the danger all around the nearby houses; everyone but Tomrin and Master Laz. 
Tomrin opened the man’s right eye with a finger. Both popped open at once. Master Laz coughed weakly. 
“What happened?” Tomrin asked.
Master Laz tried to raise his head as he looked down. His shirt, torn open, exposed the area above his heart. A ring of metallic scales glinted red in the firelight. They glinted and shined around an angry, mostly-healed wound. The Adaman woman Margretta from the courthouse had hinted at something connecting them.
“It’s finally over,” Master Laz said, his voice a bare whisper. “All the burning.”
“What?” Tomrin said. “What burning?”
“Now I barely feel a thing,” Lazoloth replied, not answering. His eyes turned away from Tomrin and stared straight ahead. “It’s like nothing at all.”
“What is?”
“You’ll see,” Master Laz said. “It’s better. This is better.” His breath was a ragged whisper. His eyes rolled up in his head and Master Laz stopped breathing.
“What? No!” Tomrin said, his voice breaking. “Why?” His vision blurred.
“What are you doing,” Rennly asked as he laid a hand on Tomrin’s shoulder. “Are you crying?”
Tomrin wiped his eyes and grabbed the ax handle as he stood. Turning, he stared at Rennly—and at Fredick. The blond boy had not disappeared as Robles had ordered. Now two more Orioles, slavers, stood with them both. The two new men wore vests and whips on their hips. Robles loped up from behind them, five Orioles to one Peregrine.
Tomrin’s grip vibrated on the ax. “You brought slavers into this, Fredick?” he said, wiping his eyes. The ax wasn’t a civilized weapon, but it was still a weapon.
“Our runaways are our own business,” the stockier of the two slavers said.
“Cut off the dead man’s shirt,” the taller said to the shorter. “We might have one with our tattoo to cross off.” 
Tomrin hefted the ax in his hands. “Master Laz was free! If you touch him...”
The shorter man pulled out his whip. “No Peregrine is free in the eyes of the gods.”
Robles prized the ax from Tomrin’s hands. “Tomrin, don’t. A man is dead here tonight. We don’t want another.” He coughed almost exaggeratedly into his hand. “We are not blood thirsty, are we?”
“We are civilized men,” Tamerton said, picking up Robles’ idea and parroting it back like a good leader. “Now this man is dead, and for love of Seasargus, no more must die here tonight.”
“We have the fire under control, Marshal?” Robles asked.
“Yes,” Tamerton replied. “The fire is under control.”
“Good.”
“What happened?” Tamerton demanded.
“An accident is all,” Robles replied.
“So you vultures can go,” Tomrin said, eyeing the slavers. 
The bulky slaver turned to the taller one. “Wasn’t one of our boys known for his lip?”
Rennly stepped in. “Stop it, now,” he said, kneeling over Laz. “I will check him. None could take exception to that.” He glanced at Tomrin and removed his belt knife. “Could they?” It was almost like he knew. A cold sweet washed over Tomrin as his knife cut bloody fabric from Master Laz. Flopping back his shirt, Rennly jerked his head and hand at the sight of the scales staring up at him. “By the demons,” he cursed, seeming genuinely surprised. Standing, he held out his hands and brushed the two slavers back. “By the Tree,” Rennly said, making the sign of the worldtree. His hand rose as if along its main trunk. “And by the three, by Freafrasus, by Reasalus—” He swung his open hand around the branches and leaves of the tree in a loop before descending back down the trunk. “And by Daedalus’ bones, and all those—” He waved his hand out over Master Lazoloth. “—and all those who now go before us into the second heaven, and for those departed, headed for the Lake of Fire, we pray for their deliverance from the demons and their servants on Enfernus or Gearthrum, wherever they may be. By the gods.”
“By the gods,” others echoed.
No sound came from Tomrin’s mouth. His eyes locked on the smaller slaver. The man stared, black hate in his heart; he wanted dearly to use his whip. “I still think we should check the boy,” the man drawled.
A clammy feeling inched up Tomrin’s fingers and headed for his heart. He feared something terrible was about to happen but Rennly turned to the man. “You were told to shut your mouth, Sam? That was your name, wasn’t it? I don’t care. Shut your mouth,” he said, his voice taking on a lilt. “From what I heard this man was like a father, and I know what a terrible thing it is to lose a father in a fire.” He paused a second and glanced at Tomrin, his green eyes callous and cruel. “I know. I lost mine in a similar blaze.” 
“But he could be a slave,” the man persisted stoutly.
“You fool,” Rennly said, rounding on him. “I’ve known Master Watersipper since he and I were children and I know for a fact—” He glanced at Robles. “—Tomrin Watersipper is owned by the emperor.”
“But—” 
“Maybe in other parts of the world!” Rennly said, loudly, “But no! Here the gods’ will be done. And I am their rod and their staff. I am their voice here, and if I say this one is a slave—and that he is duly owned by Emperor Jarvis—then he is in the eyes of the gods. Do not forget your place, Sam. For I alone here speak for the gods. Their will be done!” He sneered out a smile. His teeth appeared sharp, like tiny white daggers. He was the same vicious animal of all those years ago. Tomrin saw it clearly and shuddered. Rennly was back to manipulating everything and everyone.
“Men may never know the full story,” Robles said loudly. “Master Lazoloth will speak for himself in the heavenly courts.”
“After so many years of sin,” Rennly said. “His Purification will be some ordeal. Maybe easier for a Peregrine the years, the decades, with the scales; now I’m almost tempted to believe he was embezzling funds after all.”
“That was a lie,” Tomrin said.  “Now as then.”
“But Fredick isn’t stupid,” Robles said. He turned to the blonde Orioles as he ground the ax into the dirt. “He would be wise to let things be.” 
“Are you threatening me again?” Fredick asked. 
“I’m simply cautioning you. I am a citizen of this land. I will not light the gas. Will you? The shop is ours, Tomrin’s. With Master Lazoloth dead, control goes to him.”
“You may be a citizen,” Fredick said, but he pointed to Tomrin. “He, however, is still a slave.” 
“What are you doing?” Rennly said, turning on Fredick. “This is not the time to fight over a dead man’s company. You are not in Zircos.”
Fredick turn to Rennly. “But this was all—”
“This! This is a mess on my street! On the gods’ street!” Rennly said, harshly cutting Fredick’s words off. “I need it cleaned up! Now!”
“But—”
Rennly scowled at Fredick. “But nothing. I’m not going to stand here and listen to you degrade yourself by arguing with a slave. How about you make yourself useful and find a Daughter of Heaven’s Glory?” 
“Yes, of course,” Fredick said. He bowed and headed down the street towards the temple. 
Marshal Tamerton clapped his hands and pretended to take command. Soon, Robles and Tomrin were asked to leave, to return to the cordon with everyone else. 
“I don’t know about you,” Robles said. “But I need some sleep.” 
“Yes,” Tomrin agreed. “There is nothing else we can do here tonight.” 
When they left the cordon, Non headed home. Then Robles peeled off leaving Tomrin to climb the eastern highway alone. At the corner, the soft welcoming glow of the Winged Helm Inn beckoned with laughter and music, but he walked on. He had the shop key in his pocket and needed to use it. Lazoloth may be dead, but still he needed to fulfill the man’s trust. He needed to lock the shop.  Moreover, he had one last thing he needed to do before he could leave for Woolad in the morning. 
It was time to burn off his own scales.🔖


Chapter 11: Out of the Furnace
Heaven has them; now so do we.
—From The Arcanist’s Cookbook, a forbidden precursor to The Arcanist’s Handbook

As the door closed behind Tomrin, the Scarab’s eyes shone bright from his back workbench. Walking over and sitting down, he palmed a short length of thumb-width glass. Glass worked the best for his needs; he needed the shop, if for no other reason. “Right,” he said, preparing himself. He rubbed his eyes of the wetness put there by thoughts of Master Laz and his friend Gaz, both dead. 
Slipping his goggles over his eyes, he hoped one day he would find a better method than burning. Cutting the scales made him bleed like a stuck pig and still he needed to cauterize the wound. A bird cheeped sweetly somewhere outside, while in his chest, a mass twisted and writhed like a coiled snake, bursting to get out. It’s not me, he told himself. The evil mass wasn’t him. Yet a rhyme he knew tracked his mind as he spun the glass in the ruby flame. None stand outside the shadow line. 
The chime claimed the shadow line was imaginary, but somehow it was just as real, just as dark and light as night and day, which it supposedly separated. It was an idea which made sense in his dreams, but it was now as impenetrable as the depths of space which he could spy on with the Scarab. “Feathered riddles,” he muttered to himself as he removed the rod from the flame.
He sighed. He had forgotten to take off his shirt. He set down the rod and pulled off his goggles. “I am out of it.” 
His words filled the shop with an eerie presence, but he knew it was all in his mind; the Scarab was the only other thing around, save for the glasswork god frozen solid in the shop’s front window. “Robles is going to have nothing to do with you tomorrow morning before we leave,” Tomrin told the Scarab. “And me sitting here wasting time. I could be sleeping.” With Master Laz dead, hope seemed to melt away, disappearing into the creeping shadows, so much blood dripping before his eyes.
He let out a low sigh and walked over to the front door and checked it was locked. He wondered how many times Big Laz had done as he prepared to do now. Too often. He walked back to his station. Taking off his shirt, Tomrin whipped it over his shoulder. He could still smell the smoke of Master Laz’ house on it. The man’s lifeless eyes flashed in his mind. Tomrin swore to banish the sight. Feathers. 
Dropping his shirt on his stool’s back, he sat down and picked up the glass rod. He lowered his goggles over his eyes. After a minute the flame heated the rod to a purple glow. 
He clenched the rod with his fingers and his arms shook as he told himself, “Do it!” His words cast spittle out clenched teeth. His jaw wanted to split from the strain. His eyes wandered. This was going to hurt like the seventh heavens and the nine hells combined. It always did. Half-growling, half-yelling, he pushed the red hot end of the glass into his chest. Flesh cooked! Scales burned! A screech exited his throat and left his lips. “Eerrerrh!” 
The reek of burning skin and pain erupted from the wound as he pressed. This time, he feared he’d pressed too hard. It felt like the glass had pierced his heart and burned him dead. He slammed the rod down on the bench and cursed. “Feathers!” His hands cramped in fists as he stifled another yell as he came through the initial pain.
Suddenly, a shadow moved outside the window and materialized at the door. It knocked. Fump. Fump. “Open up.” It was a woman’s voice. A Daughter of Heaven’s Glory had found him! “I know you’re in there, Tomrin Watersipper.” 
Tomrin stood and quickly pulled on his shirt. Feathered feathers! Pain kept him focused. He pulled his shirt down over his clammy skin, hiding the cauterized wound. Slowly, he walked to the door and unlocked it. Pushing the glass door open with his right hand, his chest screamed at him. A hand from outside pulled the door the rest of the way open. “That’s how you open the door?”
“You?” Tomrin said. The Adaman woman from the court stood before him, holding the door open for herself. 
“And that’s how you address a lady?” she said as she stepped inside, brushing past him like he was nothing but a slave improperly holding the door for his mistress. 
“The shop is not open,” Tomrin said sharply. He needed to kick this woman out so he could rub the area around the burn until the pain subsided. “You’ll have to come back tomorrow.” 
The woman turned on him, her figure a dark ghost in the starlight filtering down through the skylights. “You are awfully curt with someone who has just helped save you untold trouble, young man,” she said.
“Is that what you think?” Tomrin asked her. This woman was becoming quite a nuisance. “And I am not as young as I look, Lady Margretta. And the shop, I’m afraid, is closed.” He could be proper if he chose. 
“Ha,” she scoffed. “Is that so?” 
“Yes, when I cut my beard—” He was not the kind to use an affectation as a deflection, but with the pain pumping through him he wished nothing more than to swear a string of feathers, not parse words. “We aren’t selling right now, and we certainly aren’t buying.”
“Just close the door,” she commanded. “The hour is late.” 
“Yes, and I was just leaving,” Tomrin said, sticking his head out the door. Down the street the Orish Counselor, Marten, waved to him, raising his hand in a gentle greeting. Tomrin waved back before grabbing the door handle and pulling it closed. “Not going to have your lawyer with you?”
“I’m afraid Marten is—” Margretta smacked her lips. “—overly protective.” 
“A welcome trait in a lawyer, I suppose,” Tomrin said. He felt he was doing well, not quaking in his boots, trapped as he was—and in pain. “But, as you say: the hour is late. You think you helped Master Laz, but no, he is dead.” 
“Dead?” Margretta sounded surprised, and the starlight on her cheeks revealed she was scowling. 
“An accident,” Tomrin added, not wanting to believe otherwise. 
“The fire and the explosion?” 
Tomrin cooled. “You should go.” 
“Oh?” Margretta said. “You think it is that easy to get rid of me?” 
“I can hope.”
She stepped closer and invaded his personal space. “You don’t know much.” Her eyes were dark blue pools as she looked down her nose at him. “I bet you don’t even know what your own name even means.”
“I don’t play such parlor games,” Tomrin said. “I am just a simple glass man.” 
“Really?” Margretta said and turned and walked over to the back bench where the torch gently purred. “Glass?” She held up the rod he’d used to burn the Leviathan’s Mark from his chest. “And what is this for?” 
“Nothing,” Tomrin replied, and walked over to her. He snatched the rod from her hand and waved it. “It is nothing. And at the same time it’s more than nothing to me.”
“That’s deep,” Margretta said. “Is the air more than air, water more than water?” 
Her insulting tone irked Tomrin. “You clearly don’t know the first thing about glass,” he said.
 Margretta bent and she put her eye to the eyepiece of the Scarab. “Spying on Serathus is what you are doing with it?” 
“It is not pointed at Serathus.”
“No, it is not. I see nothing.” She bent back up. “But you could use it to spy on the heavens.” MArgretta pointed at him, or maybe at his chest. “Think, if you see them, can’t they see you?”
Tomrin half-hummed, half-groaned; his wound felt like she jabbed him, but she wasn’t even touching him. Daughter, dark or not, she was certainly sent by demons to torment him. “Line of sight?” he offered obliquely. “Why are you here?” he asked. He didn’t want to deal with this woman a minute longer. “You must know I’m not going anywhere with you?” 
“I’ve met fools less stubborn than you, Tomrin Watersipper. Your master is dead...as I hear from you, and now slaver trouble crawls all over Menad. This city is a dead cow, rotting in the sun covered in ants, filled to the brim with nasty, black maggots.”
“You have no argument from me, but I am heading home tomorrow.” 
“Leaving it all behind?”
“When I return, Menad’s problems should be gone. I plan to make the shop better than before for those who wish to work here.”
“Dreams are great, but your Master Lazoloth showed what happens when you run out of cold hard currency.”
“It was an accident,” Tomrin said, calmly. “The Sapphire Front will pay us. Master Laz wasted money, I won’t.”
“So you are smarter than him?” 
“In some ways, yes.” 
The woman cackled. “You think that makes you qualified?” 
“Why wouldn’t it?” 
“Look at you. Look at your ruddy-colored hide! The races may live together in this town, but that doesn’t change the fact that old thoughts and old ways won’t die by themselves—especially when the gods themselves reinforce those ideas.” 
“The shop won’t hire people like Fredick anymore. I will hire people I, Robles, Non, and the others trust.” 
“So you do trust people, just not me?”
Tomrin walked to the door, feeling her close behind him, mimicking his steps in the dark, making him feel awkward and self conscious. “I don’t know you, and I was just leaving.” He reached out a hand to the handle. Her hand brushed his. He pulled away. “Ah—” he squawked.
“It’s just that easy for them to know,” she said and reached out for the handle again herself. “Perhaps it was how they knew about your master?” 
“I said it was an accident; if they know about me why do nothing until now?” 
“Your master was old. Perhaps they thought to use him as bait.” 
“Bait,” Tomrin breathed. “Feathered great.”
“I don’t think I need to warn you that you are not so old and so broken down as your Master Lazoloth.”
“Thanks for that,” Tomrin replied.
“It should factor into your thinking.”
Tomrin rubbed his hand where she touched him, wishing she would leave so he could scream away the pain in his chest. “I don’t know anything about anything,” he said. “Other than this: I think you should go. It is late, and your lawyer friend is waiting for you. I think you said he was protective? He’s probably worried.”
“I said he was protective, yes,” Margretta replied, exasperation in her voice. “But not for me. He worries what will happen to you should you come before the bar, and they get a load of you… Oh, the machinations.” 
“What machinations?” Tomrin said.
“Begin to comprehend—” Margretta said slowly.
“A lecture now?” Tomrin muttered. “I have fuzzy memory of my last. Perhaps write it down and send it to me?”
“Think of it this way: Two...” Margretta paused. “Two men. They were dressed in black, and were waiting for you outside at your home, sneaking about. It seems an Orish slave thought he might have seen something earlier today. With a bit of tarsk his opened his mouth real wide.”
Tomrin didn’t want to believe what he was hearing. “Waiting?”
“No more,” Margretta said. “Don’t worry. Marten has killed before.” 
“He…” Tomrin replied, not knowing where to begin.
“It has been a while for him, though not his first man in black.” 
“He’s killed censors before, then?” 
“I didn’t say they were censors,” Margretta replied coolly. “But if you worry what they might know, you might also worry that I and Marten can’t be everywhere. It was only a chance that he thought to check on you. Me. I don’t like to believe in chance. I certainly do not like to rely on it. Do you?” 
“No. I don’t.” 
Margretta opened the door. “That is wise—the first smart thing you said all day. And Tomrin Watersipper,” she added. “Think about what I’ve said. There is much for you to learn, even if you are as smart as you think. Maybe getting out of town will clear your head. As far as I can tell, you shouldn’t wait.” She stepped out of the shop and shut the door behind herself. 
Tomin put his back to the door as her opaque shadow receded through the gray of the glass worldtree.  “Feathers,” he swore and rubbed his chest. 
Finally, he pulled the key from his pocket and locked the door. Tich. He leaned back against the cool lead and rough cut glass. After a minute he pushed away and walked over to his bench. His torch still burned bright. Censors? They knew? Perhaps, but those that did were dead—if Lady Margretta wasn’t lying.🔖


Chapter 12: The Road to Woolad
It is a burden to always keep up the facade, but if you value your life and those you love, you will never lower it.
—From the Living Book of the Dead

With fingers sharp as glass, a woman poked him from the darkness. She jabbed his arms and stabbed his chest. She knifed him in the legs. He was powerless to move as her needle-sharp claws stabbed him. His rope-bound body jerked with each sharp poke, with each painful prod. Tomrin struggled to find her in the dark. A dizziness rocked him, like he was falling into an abyss. She jabbed unrelentingly, and the darkness blinded him. Shadows met him as he fell. If there were flames, only darkness flickered as they gave off no heat but sucked in light. He tried to yell at the woman, for her to stop, but he could say nothing. She cut with her hardened nails. Her words, honed to cut, dug  deeper. “You are a lie,” she crowed, sinking her razor-sharp fingernails into his chest. 
Tomrin thrashed against the pain. Needles of pain ripped through him, forcing him awake. His arms flailed and his knuckles slammed into the wall. Bruk! He grabbed his hand. “Feathers.” The needles of pain were gone, but his chest and barked knuckles still hurt. 
Tomrin squinted at the morning’s twilight filling his room with a sullen gloom—and him with irritation. He bit the ripped flesh off of his knuckles and swallowed the skin after biting it, disbelieving it was already morning. He wanted to roll over and go back to sleep, but he had to get up. 
Kicking his legs off the bed, the pain in his chest made him groan. “Gah!” Frowning at his broken cane in the corner he rubbed his eyes despite them having no sleep-sand in them. “Feathers,” he muttered for it, as much for himself. It was too early to be alive. He grabbed a pair of clean pants off the floor, his tan ones, just baggy enough to be comfortable, perfect for travel.
Standing he walked over and grabbed his pack before walking back to his bed and sitting back down. He picked up his clothes and stuffed them all into the leather satchel. Enough for ten weeks. He was only going to be gone two days, maybe three, but he could feel an argument with Mistress Fallon coming on and wanted to head it off. If she believed he was willing to move out, maybe she would try harder to keep him. 
He laced his boots up. Standing, he slung his pack over his shoulder. He adjusted it, but it still put pressure on his chest wound. Can’t be helped. He patted the papers in his pocket, checking them. Also in his pocket he found the brass shop key. Memories from the day before flooded back. 
Leaving only his cane, he stomped out into the hallways, and headed down the stairs. Benji was nowhere to be found but Mistress Fallon was in the kitchen. She blinked several times. “Leaving and it’s early enough for breakfast.” 
“I decided, I am heading home,” Tomrin said. He had no time for breakfast. “I forgot to mention.” 
“It was late.” She rubbed her hands on her apron. 
Tomrin ticked off a couple other reasons in his head. Master Laz dying, Rennly, and Fredick. “Yes. It was late and I have a funeral tomorrow, and the festival at home,” Tomrin said, changing the subject.
“And are you coming back here?” Mistress Fallon said. 
“I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe I will find another place. I was going to ask Master Lazoloth, but he’s dead now.” 
“What?” Mistress Fallon said. “Dead?”
“Yes, dead. I forgot to mention that too. It was late.”
“Dead?”
Tomrin headed for the door and opened it. “Yes, dead,” he said and left the house. He closed the door behind himself, not waiting for further questions. 
A low hanging sun peeked over the rim of the valley. It has been months since he had seen the sun rise, and now the glare was right in his eyes, yet the morning air was brisk and welcome. As he made his way down the street he greeted those who greeted him. They were a fresher bunch than he was used to, men and women heading off to work seemingly happy to be alive at this hour. You should wake up earlier more often. The lack of heat itself was more than welcome. 
The Winged Helm Inn never slept; now was no different. From the common room to the stables, grooms moved with the slow deliberate pace of too much tarsk the night before. Tomrin walked past, a nod and a wave for the porter on duty. 
At the glassworks, Non stood out front. Tomrin resisted the urge to call to him. There were others on the street, men and women who worked in the various shops on Smithy Lane. Their strides were filled with purpose. It wasn’t a strange hour for them to be in such a rush, even if it was for him. If only I didn’t hate mornings so much. 
“Morning,” Non said outside the shop. “You’re here early.”
“Morning,” Tomrin replied. He rubbed his eye of a bit of sleep he had missed. “I have the key.” He pulled the warm brass from his pocket and Non stepped aside. 
“It’s so strange, Master Lazoloth—and everything,” Non said. 
Tomrin slid the key into the keyhole on the glassdoor. “I know.” He turned the key. Chict. He opened the door. “It feels so wrong.” 
“Yet nice not having to deal with Fredick.” 
Tomrin held the door open and followed Non inside. “True.” 
Non stopped and bent down. Tomrin stepped around him. Bending up, Non handed him a letter. The letter had been dropped into the mail slot between the window and door, but it had missed the bin. Raising his eyebrows at Non, Tomrin tore open the envelope and extracted the letter. The greeting was from an undersecretary of the Sapphire Front. The letter went on for a moment before coming to the point a: ...as such, we are no longer interested in the opera glasses you are proposing.
Tomrin sucked in a breath and let it out. “I don’t think we can keep the shop open.” He handed the letter to Non. 
“But you got it working?” Non said.
“But it doesn’t work perfectly.” 
“But—” 
Tomrin ran a hand through his hair and pulled at the nape of his shirt, his chest tightened. “The question is, do you want to work cut glass?” 
Non made a face. “I’d rather take over Fredick’s work.”
“For no money?” Tomrin said. “Cut glass is all we have that currently pays.” Snatching the letter from Non, he reread it before handing it back to him.
The door opened. Robles, Ken, and Tiff entered. “The shop is dead,” Non blurted as he handed Robles the letter, who read it quickly and handed it to Ken. 
“Well, Master Lazoloth is dead,” Ken said. 
“We can’t live on no money,” Tiff said.
“You have children,” said Robles. “No one can expect you to work for free.” 
“So do we have jobs or not?” Ken asked. 
“No pay—for now,” Robles said. “But Tomrin and I can fix that. There are golden ducks everywhere.” 
“But I’m afraid it’s going to be awhile,” Tomrin said. “The Sapphire Front isn’t going to pay us, not until we find a way to convince them again. That’s going to take time.” 
“We’ll find money,” Robles said. “But for now we need to save as much money as we can. We need to fire down the forges while Tomrin and I head to Woolad for a couple days. We will look for money there.” 
“We can’t work for nothing,” Ken said. “Even now we are very near our limit.”
“Let’s close the shop for a couple days. Then when we return, we will see where we are,” Robles offered. 
Tomrin couldn’t help but feel that they were leading the man on. Tiff looked like she didn’t believe it either. “We can’t work for free,” she reiterated.
“We’ll get the money,” Robles assured her. “Now let’s get the place closed down.” He began directing the cleanup.
When Dar and Sean from the back arrived Tomrin explained the plan to them. 
“We just thought that Master Laz was innocent, but—” 
“I understand,” Tomrin said. “They pressured you to go along.” 
The two nodded sheepishly and Tomrin kicked them out of the main office using a few choice words for their cowardice.
“You didn’t need to rag on them,” Robles said after they returned from lunch and it was just the two of them at their workstations.
	“What? Who?” Tomrin said.
	“Sean and Dar.”
“Do you trust them?” Tomrin asked. Dar and Sean were Peregrine yet they had turned on Master Lazoloth.
“Yes,” Robles said.
“Is the shop clean?” Tomrin asked, changing the subject. As far as he was concerned he gave Sean and Dar everything they deserved.
“Yes.”
“It’s time then?” Tomrin said. He and Robles headed into the back. The heat was still there, but the various glows leaking from glass furnaces were softer now. 
“We’re leaving,” Robles announced.
“Come back soon,” Tiff said.
“Yes, with wheelbarrows of money,” Non added to laughs.
“I’m sure we will have great barrel loads of golden birds on our backs when we return.”
“And the percents?” Sean asked.
“We will figure all that out,” Tomrin said. 
“So we are really doing this then?” Ken said. 
“Yes, we are doing this,” Tomrin replied. The idea of going begging for a new job was no better than begging for investments. He didn’t think he could live with the idea of working in a lesser shop, cutting glass from colored sheets. 
“So Tomrin is the new master now?” Ken said.
“Yes.” 
“No,” said Robles, turning. “Not yet.” 
“That’s fine,” Tomrin said. “All I care about is the glass.” 
“Of course,” Robles said. “But if any of us leaves the shop, we lose our percents.” 
“That’s only fair,” Tomrin said. “We are all in this together.” He was glad Robles was the one to make that rule. His friend was the one most likely to grow bored and leave.
“Now,” Robles said as he glanced at the door. “Now it’s time for me and Tomrin to hit the road.”
“And be sure to lock the backdoor and latch it when you leave tonight,” Tomrin added. “We will have the key.”
“I will have the key,” Robles said.
“I don’t even want to go,” Tomrin mumbled as he locked the door gingerly. The handle was blazing hot from the sun.
“You sort of have to go for Gaz’s funeral,” Robles said, taking the key and tucking it into his pack. 
“Don’t you hate the idea of seeing Rennly again?”
Robles’ knife flashed into his hands. “Not at all. Sheep Shearing Days is always fun.”
“Even if Rennly is there?”
“Yes, I suppose so. Worried for your toes?” Robles turned and took a step towards their home—and nominally towards Woolad, their hometown.
“Wait!” Non called flying around the corner. “So you are the Flight Leader, Robles?” 
“No, I’m the Pack Leader,” Robles said as he hitched his pack to his shoulder. 
“I guess that makes Tomrin…”
“I am the King Bird of Glass,” Tomrin said. 
“And you two are coming right back with money?” 
“We’ll be back as soon as possible,” Robles said. Non, apparently satisfied, turned and headed back into the ally. Tomrin shrugged and followed Robles, hitching his own pack to adjust it. 
“I don’t think this is such a good idea,” Tomrin said to Robles when they finally crested the valley onto the rolling prairie lands. The climb out of the valley was slow, hot work, each switchback dragging them closer to the sun. “It will be good not having to deal with dead weight like Fredick dragging us down. But, what of Tiff and Ken? I can’t help but feel we are leading them on. Sean and Dar have families too, you know?”
“I know that,” Robles grunted. “Life is a gamble.”
“For us, maybe,” Tomrin said. “We can’t do that to them.”
“Do what?” Robles shrugged. “If you are worried so much, ask your father for money.”
“My father? He’d say the Watersippers didn’t become rich by giving away money to people.”
“What’s the worst that could happen?” Robles asked.
“I don’t know,” Tomrin said. “I feel like the worst has already occurred.”
“Master Laz dead?” Robles asked. “You don’t plan on following in his footsteps do you?”
Tomrin’s hand itched to rub his chest. “Hardly, but I also don’t plan on helping you lead us into ruin.”
“Them’s fighting words,” Robles said, stopping. He headed to the roadside. A small patch of conifers hid houses and farms piled up against the Eastern Highway. Robles cut a pair of walking sticks.
Tomrin grabbed the rough hewn branch Robles offered him. The dry bark flaked in his grip. Robles raised a similar cutting. He made several playful jabs at Tomrin with his branch. “Defend yourself,” he said and forced Tomrin to deflect his next jab with his scaly staff. Clack.
“If Sean’s babies go hungry…” Tomrin said, but Roble’s high swing forced him to focus or be struck in the chest.
“No one is going to starve,” Robles said. “We’ll succeed as long as you try.” He swung low.
Tomrin pushed his stick down too slowly. Roble’s tick slapped him in the leg. Clack. “Me?”  Tomrin demanded, backing up, hopping from the strike. “You’re the one who can’t seem to hold down a job for more than a few months.”
Robles pressed his attack. Clack. Clack. “I can hold them just fine… If I want to.”
“And you are not going to run out on us?” Tomrin asked, swinging his stick, missing wilding as Robles arced his body. He was as lithe as a whip.
“No.” Robles said.  “Are you?”
“No,” Tomrin said.
“Good,” Robles said, grinning, dropping the butt of his walking stick to the ground. “And we’re all happy for that—and that you are better at glass than you are at mixing sticks. And here I thought you used to be good.”
Tomrin flipped the wooden limb in his hands. “This is hardly a proper staff.” He swung low at Robles’ legs.
Robles jumped, pulling his stick up with him. “Now, that’s more like it,” he said. “Now you are getting into the spirit of Sheep Shearing Days.” 
Tomrin scoffed. “It’s been forever since I enjoyed a single thing about the feathered festival.”
“What about the food?” Robles demanded, incensed; he swung low too now.
Tomrin blocked him easily. Clack. “The festival is kid’s nonsense.”
“The childish fun is the point.”
“We’re not children anymore,” Tomrin said whirling. The dry road puffed. The bone dry highway was ground to a fine powder, to a dust even a heavy rain would not easily penetrate. 
“True,” Robles said, swinging his branch at Tomrin’s chest. Tomrin turned and caught the stick with his shoulder instead. Chut. He swung himself. His stick struck Robles. Frack. They both made hits. One point each. Dropping stance, Robles took a breather. “And we are going to have to act it now—if we want money.” 
Tomrin scoffed, slapping the stick from under Robles. “Like us fighting in the road instead of getting out of this feathered heat?” His chest wound ached, and a thirst settled in his throat. “We’re sweating for no good reason. We should have brought some water.” 
Robles swung. Clack. “You know what I mean,” he said, before setting the point of his stick in the dust again. “Like being willing to cut glass—and begging for money.” 
Tomrin leaned on his own stick. His feather chest burned. “And mount cut glass?” he asked.
“Is that where you draw the line?” Robles asked.
“I just hope the glass shop will be leaner now.” 
“We’ll still need the money,” Robles said.
“Money is nothing but a pain in my tailfeathers,” Tomrin said, adjusting his pack.
Robles swung his stick up, dragging a cloud of dust into the air. Dirt and branch flew at Tomrin’s middle. His father had wanted him to be good at staves and some of the old training kicked in as his stick lept to intercept Robles’. Clack. His staff then smacked his friend across the waist. Fump. For himself, there was no way of getting out of the dirt’s way. Sand and pebbles pelted him even as he scored the hit. 
“You dirty dog,” Tomrin said. “You could have hit my eyes.” 
Robles laughed. “If you didn’t still have it.” He rubbed himself where the staff had struck him. 
Tomrin dropped his stick into the dust “A nip of your tarsk,” he said. “Then we will call it even.” 
Robles dropped his stick and shrugged his pack from his back. “I’m not sure that’s how it works,” he said, but began undoing the straps. He reached in and pulled out his glass flask. The bottle was a brilliant green. He unstopped it and took a sip. “Ahh,” he said, offering it to Tomrin. “High-spirit tarsk.” 
Tomrin took the flask. “I thought I meant real tarsk.” 
“Just drink it,” Robles said. “It will warm you up.” 
Tomrin took the bottle. “That’s just what I need.” He put the flask to his lips and took a swig. “Gah! It’s harsh.” 
Robles snatched the bottle away and corked it. “Not harsh. Strong.” He stuffed the bottle back into his pack and rebuckled the straps. Hoisting the pack onto his shoulders, he picked up his stick and stood. “Now let’s go before we grow truly thirsty.” Tomrin groaned. “What’s the matter now?” Robles asked. 
“Just sore,” Tomrin said. 
“It’s that drubbing I gave you.” 
“I’m sure that’s what it is,” Tomrin said, dismissively. 
“Just the price of my glorious company.”
The sun began to drop in the west. Tomrin supposed his parents would already be home, returned from the lower steppes lands, back to the last gasp of civilization—if Woolad could be called such a thing.
Dable Watersipper’s carpentry shop had burnt to the ground. Afterwards the family left Woolad to wander the steppes, searching for a Serath’s feather. Herding goats and sheep and oxen was no life for Tomrin, but his mother, Janet, believed in the old ways. His husband, Dable, seemed to accept them too.
“You know what I find odd?” Robles said. “Master Laz dies, and just like that, the Sapphire Front cancels their order. I can’t help but feel Rennly did something to make that happen. Him, Fredick, both at the Inn, then Rennly was skulking around the courthouse yesterday. Then at Master Lazoloth’s house...”
“You saw Rennly at the courthouse also?” Tomrin said. 
“Yes. Why? Did he do something?”
“I don’t know,” Tomrin said. He suspected Margretta, the shadowy lady from the courthouse.
“If it was him, I think we—”  Robles tried to say.
Tomrin cut him off. “We need to keep away from him.”
“No. Not at all,” Robles said, giving him a look. “It’s always better to watch your enemies. Never let them stab you in the back.” 
Tomrin pondered his friend’s words as they walked along in silence. They crested the hill of Turtle Pass and Woolad appeared in the distance. “Finally,” Tomrin grunted. 
“Welcome to Woolad,” Robles said, sardonically. “A grand land, but with old slaver ways.”🔖


Chapter 13: Woolad
Never forget these famous last words: I know how fire works.
—From the Archanist’s Handbook

A fresh coat of whitewash covered the Old House Inn. Out front, wooden bears carved from large tree stumps were once charming and rustic, but they were now also painted white, making them look off and wrong. 
“Sure you don’t want to stay with me at my aunt’s place?” Robles said, eyeing the white bears skeptically.
Tomrin thought about Robles’ question. He didn’t dislike Robles’ aunt—she wasn’t a bad person, she just wanted to know things. “No, I think I will stay here,” Tomrin said. “Get a drink with me?” 
“Not now. I best run home. Aunty will want to prepare for sleep. Being late would tax her poor heart. You know how she is, how she likes to worry.” 
Tomrin grunted. “See you later tonight?” he asked. 
“I might head down for a drink. If not, I’ll see you at the funeral in the morning.” 
“Then we look for money,” Tomrin said.
“Lots of old money comes into town,” Robles said. “Hate to say it, but you’re right, Gaz died at a good time for us.” Robles made a lopsided grin. “Don’t run off and get the constables called.”
Tomrin tossed his walking stick into the ditch beside the road. “I won’t."
“That’s good to know, a real load off my shoulders,” Robles said. “Just what we need: a Founder in the jail in Woolad. You know?” 
Tomrin sighed. “I didn’t hit Fredick.” 
Robles tossed his own ratty walking stick into the ditch. “Never said you did. I better go.”
“Same,” Tomrin said. His boots crunched up the gravel walkway to the commons.
The door was open, but no one acted as porter. There was no music either, though snatches of laughter from the back reached Tomrin’s ears as he entered. A front room which adjoined the hallway to the right stood empty. Usually someone manned the front counter. Not today. On the counter, a brass bell sat on a ceder stand. Words were carved into it: RING FOR SERVICE.
Tomrin knew the sign but had never rung the bell before. He reached to pick up the bell but a shadow darkened the door behind him. He pulled his hand back. 
Boots struck the floor and he turned around. “Rennly,” he said. 
“I just rode in,” Rennly said pleasantly. He had a Daughter with him. There could be no mistake. She was Rubish and wore green silk. Her necklace held three jewels, three clear diamonds as white as stars. Her red face was flush from the sun, and her dress shone like leaves.  
“Robles—I and Robles—” Tomrin stammered. “We just got here.” 
“You know this boy?” the woman asked Rennly. 
“Yes?” Rennly grunted at her dismissively, adding to Tomrin. “Robles is here? I just see you.” He walked to the counter and picked up the bell. “You rang, right?” 
“Uh, no—was going to.”
Tomrin refused to look at the woman as Rennly ran the bell. Clang. Clang. Clang. Rennly set the bell back down. “The new owners,” Rennly said, and shook his head. “Weird but—” 
The door to the left opened and a man several years their senior and wearing an apron walked out. “Censor Rickot,” the man said as he wiped his hands on a towel. “You have arrived.” 
"I keep my reservations, Master Fenway.” Rennly glanced at Tomrin. “And my promises.” Rennly smiled. “I promise you that.” 
Words spoken long ago skittered through Tomrin’s mind. I promise you that! Rennly had the same gleaming teeth, the same granite face, and the same words. Tomrin’s chest began to throb.
Rennly turned back to the man behind the counter. Master Fenway flipped through the files in a metal box he retrieved from behind the counter. “Yes of course, Censor,” Fenway said. He pulled a slip of cardstock from the case. “Yes, I have you for tonight, but it is a single room.” The man glanced at Tomrin. 
“What about me?” Tomrin asked him. 
“No rooms for slaves, I’m not even allowed to put you up in the outhouses.” The man laughed. 
“What?” Tomrin said. “I’m not a slave.”
“Apologies...” The man thumbed through his files. “...but unless you are Master Ithus Calway...” 
“No, I’m Tomrin Watersipper.” 
“Well in that case, Mister Tomrin,” the man said, looking back up. “No reservation.” He shrugged. “No room.” 
Tomrin began sweating. “What am I supposed to do?” 
“I don’t know,” the man said. “You know Sheep Shearing Days starts tomorrow?” 
“Yes,” he replied. 
“And I’m sure it’s not because you’re Peregrine,” Rennly said. “Though you are.”
The Daughter tittered at Rennly’s jest while the man behind the counter sputtered. “No, not at all. I have many Peregrine friends.” 
“Don’t get all bent out of shape, Tomrin,” Rennly said, enjoying himself. “It’s not Master Fenway’s fault you were too lazy to send him a letter asking for a reservation.” 
The man behind the counter shrugged, and Tomrin felt a fool in front of him and the Daughter. He just wanted to leave. “Well, thank you anyway,” he said quickly. “I’m sure I will find something.” He hurried out the door, hoping he would catch Robles. A night at his friend’s aunt’s didn’t seem so bad. Even the food smelled muddled, Tomrin assured himself as he left the Old House Inn. Like heartburn and unfulfilled dreams. 
Passing the festival grounds, he saw the Watersipper family wagon, but told himself not to stop. He walked on towards Robles’ aunt’s place instead. He didn’t want his friend to come looking for him at the Old House Inn and not find him. Up a side street, past a row of houses and to the one where she lived, Tomrin climbed the steps and grabbed the brass knockers. Picking it up, he let it drop. Tunk. He dropped it twice more. Tunk. Tunk. Motion and the sound of boots on the floorboards came from inside. 
Robles’ welcome grin peeked through the high windows of the door and disappeared. The door swung open, and Robles bowed. “Welcome, traveler! Welcome,” he said, swinging his right hand low and bowing. “Enter, my goodman.” 
Tomrin entered the house. “Thank you. Thank you.” The place was a good deal smaller than the others nearby, but it had a shop outback covered in tin.
“Aunty, look who’s here—it’s Eggy.” 
“Buggy!” Robles’ aunt said looking up. She was writing at the dining room table.
A large carpeted chair split the front room from the dining room. It was filled with clothes, books, bags, and overflowing with paper. The table itself was just as cluttered. A pair of boots stood in the middle of the mess which hid the table top. Eggy, Toady, Buggy, Robles’s aunt had a new nickname for Tomrin every time they met it seemed. Buggy, however, she had used before.
“Good evening, Cordelia,” Tomrin said. “Sorry to call so late, but I wasn’t able to find a room at the Old House Inn. No reservation.” 
“Well, of course you couldn’t,” Cordelia said. She launched into an explanation as to who exactly the new owner of the Old House Inn was and how he came to be so peculiar as to paint the bears white. 
Tomrin groaned to himself as she began mentioning the man’s relations. Tomrin didn’t care, and it wasn’t like he was going to be staying there anyway. “Hmm. Right. Yes. Ah?” he said in all the right spots. “So I just came by to let Robles know I was not going to be staying there.” 
“So where are you staying?” Robles said. 
“My parents are in town,” Tomrin said. “I guess, I will stay with them.” 
“I saw your sister and father earlier,” Cordelia said. “All I can say is your poor mother, Buggy. Your father is a cad. And your sister, Buggy…? Your sister?” She didn’t wait for Tomrin to answer but trampled him under the horse-shod of her words. “Now, there is a fine looking girl. She has turned into an angel from the gods. It was like meeting up with an angel and a demon, both, seeing your father and sister together. I swear the years haven’t touched your father a lick. He hasn’t grown up a bit. Not one tiny bit.” 
“Yes,” Tomrin said. Cordelia wasn’t wrong. His father was a bit of a card. Tomrin turned to Robles. “I was thinking about—” Tomrin cut himself off. Robles’ aunt didn’t like Robles drinking tarsk. 
“What?” 
“Oh, nothing. I was just thinking I better be going,” Tomrin said. “I haven’t stopped to see my family yet.”
“I’ll come with you,” Robles said.
“But Arty,” Cordelia said. “It’s late.”
“Don’t worry, Aunty. We are kings of this town,” Robles told his aunt, planting a quick kiss on her cheek. “Who would dare rob us here? And don’t stay up for me.”
“I won’t,” his aunt said. “But please don’t be too long. Remember, I am leaving the door unlocked so you can get in. With the festival you never know who is about.”
Robles shook his head yes and turned to Tomrin. “I’ll walk you home, and see for myself if your sister really is a messenger for the gods,” he said. Robles made show of leaving his pack in the corner. Yet the sun was setting before they finally managed to exit, his pack safely on his back.
 “I need a drink,” Tomrin said.
“Yes,” Robles replied. “This is going to be harder than we thought.” 
“What do you mean?” 
“The money,” Robles said. “Aunty says money has dried up with the Woolad creek.” 
“It couldn’t have disappeared completely.” 
“No, that’s true, but everyone—and not just the misers are holding on to every copper.”
“Well if we don’t have someone big on board, we are going to have nothing. Does your aunt know anything about that?” 
“Her exact words were: The generous are acting frugal, and the frugal are like misers, and the misers like the sky this year with its rain.” 
“So the plan is ruined?”
“No, not ruined,” Robles said. “Only harder than we expected.”
“All I know is people are depending on us, Robles.”
Robles waved hello to Master Stockling and his wife sitting on their porch watching the sunset. Tomrin had ignored them on his way up the street, but now he waved awkwardly as well. 
“We might have to look further afield is all,” Robles said as they turned down Fairway Lane. On one side of the street was the city park, and on the other side the festival grounds. 
Beyond the campgrounds, the street gathered tents and wagons. The park was filled now with as many booths and tents as the grounds with its pavilions erected next to the permanent festival buildings. All spread shadows. 
“And take more risks?” Tomrin said.
“Perhaps,” Robles allowed. The sound of animals in the pens reached them over the largely quiet grounds. Robles stopped in front of a closed gate. 
“I don’t know,” Tomrin said, as he eyed the closed gate. “I don’t like risks. Risks were what got Master Lazoloth in trouble. I don’t want to end up like him.” 
Robles walked to a section of the fence meant to keep carts and wagons out. A simple heavy rope hung between the posts. He ducked under and held it up for Tomrin to do the same. “I doubt we will end up dead. Unless… You aren’t thinking of killing yourself in a crazy explosion?” 
Tomrin ducked under. “No.”
“Well, good.”
Tomrin wasn’t worried about killing himself, not even to forgo Purification for his own Leviathan’s Mark. He could feel the mass inside his chest, and unless Lady Margretta could not be trusted a lick, others could feel it too—if they touched him. He rubbed his chest. “Don’t you think we could get into trouble, tromping through here?” he asked. The lanes and paths through the buildings and tents were paved with white quartz gravel which glittered where the sun peeked through. 
Robles grunted. “How would anyone know we don’t have animals entered?” 
“That’s true,” Tomrin agreed. “Though lying courts an ill fate, the last thing we need.” 
Robles headed straight to the longest pavilion, the knife toss tent. Inside, two large bales of golden straw sat bound and tied lengthwise. A painted bullseye spotted each. In front of the round targets, ropes marked the ground at ten, fifteen, and twenty paces. “Now, this is probably against the rules,” Robles said. “Practicing here.” 
His knife flashed into his hands and he stepped to the twenty-pace mark. Fizt-futh. The blade buried itself, down to its hilt, dead in the right-hand bale’s red bullseye. 
“I don’t know how knife tossing is even legal,” Tomrin said as Robles walked down the small alley to collect it. 
“Missiles are only illegal if they have launchers.” 
“I know, but you are just as deadly. Your arm is the launcher.” 
Robles tucked his blade away. “What can I say?” He grinned. “I’m a dangerous man.”
“Let’s get out of here,” Tomrin said. “I need to find a place to sleep tonight with my parent’s still.” 
“Your old tent?” 
“I’ll have to set it up in the dark,” Tomrin said and headed south towards the camp grounds. “That is if they brought it.” 
“Oh, here is the sparring ring for the staff competition,” Robles said as they turned down one of the foot paths. “They moved it this year.” He walked over to a barrel stuffed with sticks, regulation staves for the matches. Pulling a staff from the wooden barrel, he tossed it to Tomrin, pushing the center, causing it to wobble as it flew. 
It was little more than a heavy gray bar in the twilight. Tomrin caught the staff with his right hand. It slapped his palm a painful strike. “Ah!” 
It looked like those from previous years harvested from a grove on the Gorkel’s family farm. They ran the competition for as long as Tomrin remembered, since the start of the festival—or so they claimed. The yew wood was nothing like the bark covered walking stick from earlier. 
He swung the staff through the air. Whoorf. “Now this,” he said. “This is a civilized weapon.”
A woman’s voice, low and dulcet, spoke behind him. “Is it now?”
Tomrin swung around. Rennly and the Daughter walked up an ungraveled sidepath. Tomrin dropped the butt of his staff to the ground and deftly brushed his left hand against his chest. “I would like to say it has always been one, Daughter.”
He couldn’t help but feel Rennly was following him, even if the two walked from the opposite direction. 
The woman turned to Rennly. The way she touched his arm, their relationship wasn’t strictly professional. “You will fight him in the competition?” she said.
“No,” Tomrin said quickly. “I have given up fighting.”
“Like you’ve given up working hard?” Rennly said.
“It’s not laziness that I don’t fight,” Tomrin said. “If I was in Zircos I’d be one of those fighting the Kobryant right now.”
“Oh really?” the Daughter said.
Rennly laughed cruelly. “Yes, Tomrin, tell us how us you think to mutiny.”
Robles pushed forward. “I think what Tomrin is saying is he fights good causes, and everyone knows this Stanely Kobryant is a pretender from a long line of pretenders.”
“A good cause?” Rennly mused. “Robles, I don’t think you have met Daughter Calena.”
Robles bowed. “Robles Kopendrus, at your service.”
“Seems you have changed your mind yet again, Robles.” Rennly said, raising an eyebrow at the staff in Robles’ hand.
“I have changed my mind about many things,” Robles replied. “I am not so enamored with any one of my thoughts as to let them control me. But, which of them are you referring to specifically?” 
“A staff in your hand, isn’t it?” Rennly asked.
“Oh this?” Robles said. “This is just a stick to me.” He dropped to the ground with a thud. “I prefer something a little sharper, a knife say? Blunt things are more Tomrin’s area of expertise.” 
“Probably just as well. Be a coin-flip’s chance you’d show up.”
“Never know what else might come up,” Robles said. “One can’t ruin his fun and games running it as a slave ship, now can he?” 
“Maybe you can’t,” Rennly said, swatting Robles’ words from the air with his right hand. “But Tomrin is used to being a slave.” 
“Look, you’ve angered him,” the Daughter said, holding out a hand towards Tomrin. In the descending darkness her hand seemed to glow like it was charged with lightning.
Tomrin’s anger at Rennly evaporated. Blood rushed from his face, and his hands tingled. He couldn’t run; he stood transfixed holding the staff as he stared fixedly at her hand. In the gloom-darkened festival grounds, the shadows of dusk loomed up the sides of nearby tents to suffuse their walls to cradle the world in a dark hand. At the center of that darkness Daughter Calena stood glowing.
She knows? But she couldn’t. In the quick pause, Tomrin considered her outreached hand. Gripping his staff with both hands, he bowed, positioning it horizontal in front of himself. “I take no offense at the truth,” he said. “I am but a Peregrine and slave, the emperor is my master, and after Gaz’s funeral I am heading home to Menad. No time for fun for me.” 
“You wouldn’t leave town just like that?” Rennly said. “This was always Gaz’s favorite time to goof and play. To leave like that would dishonors his memory.”
“And you say the staff is a civilized weapon?” Calena said. “Is that a thing?” 
“Civilized as weapons go,” Tomrin said. He didn’t want to continue talking to Rennly and was surprised he preferred this Daughter of Heaven’s Glory. 
She made a small noise. “Hmm?”
“He’s always been like this,” Rennly said.
“Like what?” Tomrin asked. 
“Slippery with words,” Rennly said. “Hard to pin you down; you always have some excuse when you want to get out of something.” 
“I’m not sure what you mean,” Tomrin said. “But I refuse to believe you are calling me a liar. I don’t like weapons and that is the truth.” 
“I’m afraid Tomrin is just too idealistic,” Robles said. “Or he likes to use words in ways that don’t make sense...maybe that’s it?” 
“I try to be precise,” Tomrin said. “Not my fault people can’t follow me.” 
“I think you forgot something,” Robles said. “We are also looking for money for the glass shop.” 
“True,” Tomrin said. He sighed. He had forgotten in the heat of the moment.
“So now you are looking for money to keep the glassworks open?” Rennly said. 
“What glassworks?” the Daughter added. 
“Godly Glassworks,” Robles said. “We are taking over where Master Lazoloth left off.” 
“So that glass shop, and that Master Lazoloth?” Calena asked pointedly. “Doesn’t sound so godly to me.” 
“Master Lazoloth made mistakes,” Robles said. 
“Mistakes?”  Rennly scoffed. “Even now the purple carpet is flying over the temple in Menad. More than a mistake, he was Marked.”
“Yes. But we aren’t,” Robles piped cheerfully. 
“And the work we are doing is important,” Tomrin added. 
“Oh really?” Calena said, sounding intrigued. “How so?” 
Tomrin found himself wanting to know her better. “It’s hard to explain how important glass is,” Tomrin said. “Everyone thinks it is just sand heated up until it melts but it’s so much more than that. How far we can take it? What can it do ultimately? No one knows for sure. But I think we have just only begun to scratch the surface.”
“He sounds like an Arcanist on Serathus,” Calena said to Rennly. 
“Yes,” the Rennly said. “Very interesting. Glass. And you say you need money? And here is Calena and I. She is the new Vault Keeper.” 
“Congratulations, Vault Keeper,” Robles said. “But I doubt Seasargus, the Golden Hearted, would be happy to find his gold with us without his authorization.” 
“He most certainly wouldn’t,” Calena said. “That I am sure, Rennly.” 
“Just observing,” Rennly said easily. “But I have money of my own. When my mother died, she left me a sum of money. And the gods pay me handsomely.” 
The idea of taking Rennly’s money, even to keep the glass shop open twisted in Tomrin’s belly. “We wouldn’t want to impose—” 
“How much money are you talking?” Robles said, cutting him off. 
“Let’s just say more than a few golden ducks.” 
“We are looking for quite a few,” Robles said. 
“And it would be a gamble,” Tomrin added, trying to scare him away. 
“Then I need to know it will be worth the risk.” 
“Aren’t you a gambler?” Robles asked. “It’s not all about the percent; it’s about if you have the hit.”
“I like to win more than I lose,” Rennly said stiffly. “That’s why I bet on winning horses.” 
“The glassworks is a horse that can hardly lose,” Robles said. 
“Let me tell you what,” Rennly said. “Calena and I still have something we need to do tonight. Come with us…  Then I will make you a proposition.” 
Tomrin glanced at a shadowy Robles then back to Rennly. “I don’t—” 
“We’ll go with you,” Robles said. 
Tomrin wasn’t sure how he felt about going anywhere with Rennly, or with a Daughter of Heaven’s Glory. “I guess my parents can wait,” he said. “Where are we going?” 
“We are going to see Gaz. And it is a good thing you agreed,” Rennly said, grabbing his nightstick. “Or who knows…”
“We are delighted to join you,” Robles said. 
Tomrin wasn’t sure delighted was the right word. He replaced his staff in the barrel and Rennly repaired his weapon to his waist. Tomrin would have bet Rennly was only partly joking about using violence to get what he wanted. I need to be extra careful. Some people never change.🔖

Chapter 14: A Dark Ritual
And yet, those who lose their sight by eyes, 
May yet see all clearly in broken riddles.
	—From The Dark Verses

Going to see Gaz meant only one thing with a Daughter of Heaven’s Glory in tow. She planned to use her gift. The idea of being around someone willingly spelldancing made Tomrin’s skin want to crawl and he sweated despite the cool evening air.
	When alone, and on similar treks, gloom would push in—so would fear. As a boy Tomrin had run from light to light—when there were any lights at all. He could easily run from one end of Woolad to the other, a thing he’d done in terror more than once, afraid of imagined blood beasts chasing him. Now, as he walked down the street to the charnel house where Gaz slept, Serathus lit the way. When he could, Tomrin stole glances at Calena.
She was not unpretty but perhaps a little pump, as was common for her Rubish race. This close to the border a Rubish and an Orioles was not uncommon, but her relationship with Rennly occupied a corner of Tomrin’s mind. He had her fooled like everyone else.
“No,” Tomrin said in answer to one of her questions. “I don’t miss Woolad.” Robles had tried to weasel Rennly’s proposal out of him, but whatever it was Rennly was adamant that they had to wait until after they had visited Gaz’s dead body. He had turned the discussion to the notable and the quaint life and times in the Woolad of their youth. “Nothing has changed in Woolad since I left,” Tomrin said. “And that’s the problem with it. It’s not that late but already the town is sleeping or reveling. Menad would only now be readying itself for dinner.”
“You just want to revel every night,” Rennly leveled.
“As do I,” Robles added with a laugh, and shouted to house guests on the left. “To reveling every night!”
“Well, I grew up in Corundum,” Calena puffed. “It hasn’t changed either. But it never sleeps—and that is its problem.” 
“I always wanted to go to Corundum,” Robles said. “How was it?” 
Calena talked about the capital. “The shrine is large, but it’s nothing like on Serathus,” she said. “The Altar Mountain is its own city, its own nation, nothing like it on Gearthrum, maybe the Center Lands, but those are spread out. And on the Altar Mountain, the Serath are everywhere you turn.” 
“I thought you didn’t want to get into it with a bunch of hicks?” Rennly ribbed Calena. 
Tomrin was finding himself liking the young woman. It was a shame she was a Daughter of Heaven’s Glory. She answered Rennly as the street leveled off and the temple finally loomed up in front of them. The structure, large once, now was just a building which would disappear in Menad. “You said yourself, your friends aren’t the small-town types. They do seem more like men of the world.” 
“That we are,” said Robles. “And here we are—the Woolad Temple—the greatest building in all this vast city.” The steeple cut a squat silhouette in the stars, but Robles actually sounded proud.
Rennly led them to the back of the temple, to where the charnel house held the newly departed who await burial in the nearby graveyard. The building squatted—only two stories high, barely tall enough to let in a Serath. A small flagstone walkway connected the house of the dead with the temple. The iron doors hung closed with chains slung between the door handles. The chain was there to keep out wild animals, and blood beasts, or so Tomrin had believed when he was a child.
Rennly unthreaded the chains. Clig, clig, clig. Yawning darkness peaked out the open doors as a bad breath wafted out. 
“Brings back memories.” Rennly said, swallowing. “Don’t it?”
Robles answered. “So dark.” His voice was but a whisper.
“I will give us light,” the Daughter of Heaven’s Glory said. Her words echoed. 
Before Tomrin could make sense of her meaning, an orange light flared up inside the charnel house. Shadows lept into existence as Calena’s hands moved with a fluid grace. A ball of flame gently quavered above her as she spelldanced.
Tomrin’s belly filled with ice as she glided into the vault. Her ball of orange fire floated in the air above her. Square iron doors lined the walls. They head back into the charnel house, storage for the unclaimed dead. 
At the far end, a stone table held a form draped in red velvet. Gaz. His belly had grown overlarge. Tomrin swallowed and strode forward after a glance out into the night sky. He wasn’t sure Rennly’s money was worth this—acting like spelldancing was nothing.
Calena stopped seven or so paces from Gaz. Her flaming orb hung in the air over the velvet form on the table. “What are we waiting for?” Tomrin asked. He expected someone to pull back the cover. It was why they were here, wasn’t it? 
“I am about to allow us to commune with your dead friend,” Calena said. “But you need to know not to touch his spirit. It is best that you do not even speak with him directly as you are not equipped or trained as I or Censor Rickot is.” 
Communing with the dead sounded like dark magic, like something a Dark Daughter would attempt. In a flash Tomrin understood this was how Daughters knew everything.
“Why not touch his spirit?” Robles said. 
“Focus on what she’s saying,” Rennly said sharply.
Orange light glinted off Calena’s bright eyes as she glanced between them. She was bathed in her counterfeit sunlight. Her golden hair gave up an inner light and her placid face spoke of serene contemplation. Her movements were like a swan in flight. “If you touch the form, your friend’s anger, hate, pain and suffering will enter you. It is the opposite of the Luster, or so I’m told.”
“The Luster is good?” Tomrin asked, confused. 
“Focus,” Rennly said.
“We’re focused,” Robles said.
Tomrin added, “And we’re listening.” 
“Even if you don’t touch him, it will be bad, you’ll feel things and smell them,” Calena continued. “Unpleasant things.” 
“How unpleasant?” said Robles. 
“You’re not afraid, are you?” Rennly asked. “Tomrin is already turning green.” 
“I’m not afraid,” Tomrin said, feeling exactly that. This was turning into some strange nightmare where a beautiful creature promised him pain and suffering while Rennly goaded him into something he wasn’t sure he wanted to do. “Let’s just get it over with.” If he had no choice, the sooner it was over, the better. 
“The Luster hurts?” Robles asked.
Calena frowned. “What?” she said as Tomrin bit his bottom lip to keep from correcting Robles’ misapprehension. 
“You mean the bond?” the woman said. “If you mean the bond, you have no idea what pain is until you try to go against the will of the gods.” 
“That’s why we don’t,” Tomrin said.
“Right,” Robles said.
Tomrin wondered at her words. It seemed the poor woman was nothing but a slave herself. Just because her master was a Serath didn’t mean she wasn’t. 
“Good,” she said. The light winked out.
“This feels wrong,” Tomrin said, glancing at the bright hole in the darkness which was the far doors. No starlight penetrated this far in.
“And she hasn’t even started yet,” Rennly said. His words had a jeering tone, almost laughing. He was enjoying this. In the dark, the years were stripped away as if by foul magic.
Tomrin shuddered. “Why do we have to do this again?” he asked. 
“Who is the coward now?” Rennly said, slapping Tomrin across his chest. 
The pain tingled up to the tip of Tomrin’s head. “Ahh!”
“Just do it already,” Robles said, setting a hand on Tomrin’s shoulder.
Calena’s voice came slow, harsh, and bitter. “Don’t rush me!” 
Robles pulled his own hand back to himself. The darkness stretched. Slowly the air began to swirl and glow around Gaz’s body. The mist coalesced; time seemed to stand still. The strange mist churned. 
Tomrin gasped. He wasn’t sure what he expected. The velvet cover had turned from red to gray in the ghastly light. The air suddenly stank of corpses, of jellied blood, and of rot and death. A shadowy apparition of Gaz stood at the center of the churning mist. Tomrin coughed. “Chaah!” He wanted to retch and keep on retching. 
Rennly laughed, yet Gaz stared blankly forward, seemingly oblivious of the foulness swirling all around him. A bit of light leaked out what looked like a gash on his forehead. His true body had not moved an inch.
“I can’t believe I’m seeing this,” Robles said, sounding amazed, not sickened. “This is something I can tell my children; I bet they won’t believe me.”
Tomrin stared at the unblinking shade. The stench made it difficult for him to focus on anything but drawing quick breaths through his mouth and out his nose. Still an evil one to rival the one growing in him seemed to lodge itself, breath-by-breath, into his lungs, like he would never be clean again.
Tomrin wished he’d never come, but he was happy to see Gaz wasn’t the lined, hard man on the street the previous morning. Still he was afraid this was how he would remember Gaz, an ugly shade, not the slow witted boy he’d known from his youth.
“Both of you be quiet,” Rennly said into the murky silence. “I will speak for us. If you say a word out of line…” Satisfied, he continued. “How many tins of tarsk did you drink the night you died, Gaz?”
The shade looked at Rennly. Gaz’s mouth moved, but the words did not seem to come from him even though they were in his voice. They came from everywhere, from the mist itself, or from inside Tomrin’s own head. It was almost as if the words were his own memories. “I don’t remember, four or five,” Gaz said.
“So when you fell down the cliff, you bumped your head and died?” 
A finger went up and touched the gash which bled gray light. “I hit my head.” The finger withdrew. “And I died.”
Rennly turned to speak to Calena. “I think I heard enough,” he said. 
“That’s it?” she replied. 
“I don’t need to hear all the gory Orish details.” 
The light faded and Tomrin could feel himself breathe again as Calena ended her spelldance. “That wasn’t by the book,” she said.
“It doesn’t need to be. Gaz was my friend and I knew him to be clumsy, always falling down.” 
Tomrin didn’t remember Gaz always falling down because of being clumsy, but because Rennly pushed him, or hit him. Poor Gaz never stuck up for himself. It still shamed Tomrin that he didn’t always stick up for Gaz even when he could. Suddenly, a ball of fire returned and bathed them in warm, golden light.
Wasting no time, Robles turned to Rennly. “I’d like to hear your proposal.” 
“Walk and speak,” Calena said. 
They followed her and the high-flying ball of flame. “Of course, my proposal,” Rennly said. “I’m thinking. Tomorrow, in the staff competition. Tomrin beats me, I’ll agree to give you two money to help run your shop.”
They exited the vault and the orb of light winked out. By starlight Rennly straightened the chain with Robles help. 
“So, what do you say, Tomrin?” Robles said as Rennly tried the doors, jiggling the handles. The sound of the metal bound doors clanging resounded low and muffled echoes. Bonh, bonh. 
“Well, I don’t—”
“Don’t say, no,” Robles said, putting a hand up. He turned to Rennly. “We will let you know tomorrow.” 
“Fine,” Rennly said. “Talk it over. Calena?” 
“I’m not dressed for this cold.” She sounded annoyed and ready to leave.
Tomrin wanted to be elsewhere himself. He and Robles said goodbye to Rennly and Calena. Then Rennly and Calena took off down the hill while Tomrin and Robles walked along the high street. 
“I think you need to do the staff competition,” Robles said. 
“Why? So Rennly can beat me with a stick?” 
“But if you win?” 
“I can’t win,” Tomrin said. “Don’t you see what he is doing?” 
“Of course I can.” 
“Really. He still blames me for his father. He wants to get even. He could even kill me.”
Robles hemmed. “We’re smart. We’ll think of something.”
“I’m not going to do it,” Tomrin said. “I’m not that good at the staff anymore. I never really was.”
“Right,” Robles. “You were sort of good.” 
“I don’t know. It’s still Rennly.”
“I’m just thinking aloud,” Robles said. “There was something wrong with how he treated Gaz there… Mistreated him.” 
“I thought so too.”
“Or it could just be Rennly being Rennly,” Robles said.
They reached the cross street leading to his aunts. Tomrin glanced up the alley. Here houses stood watch over the top of the small picket fences. The houses were painted varying colors by day, but now stood gray and tired. The people and houses slept.
Tomrin stopped and turned to Robles. Robles stopped as well. “Doesn’t it seem odd to you?” Tomrin said, staring up the gray street. “We just witnessed spelldancing and spoke with the dead, yet here we are talking about money as if it’s the most important thing in the world?” 
“Not just money,” Robles replied, grinning. “Gold.” 
“I don’t care about gold.”
“Come now,” Robles said, sounding skeptical. “Everyone wants gold.”
“Gold,Balls of fire, and unfeeling sprites?” Tomrin said with a scoff. “What are those compared to far sight, and...and?” 
Robles made a noise in his throat. “And Master Laz’s ramifications?”
“Exactly.”
“Maybe Rennly was right about us being men of the world,” Robles offered.
“That’s nonsense.” Tomrin replied. “I’ve seen enough of the world to know that.” 
“Spoken like a true man of it,” Robles said, continuing along the street. 
Tomrin stepped after him. “Not going home?”
“Not yet,” Robles said. “I need to see you safely home.”
Tomrin stepped beside him. “I’ve read tracts on the rudiments of spelldancing,” he said. “There is nothing to it, just channeling anger, fear, and whatnot.” He hadn’t followed it all, but he’d followed it enough to know there was nothing sublime about it. “The mysteries of the cosmos, those of glass are greater I think... I don’t know.”
“Well, since we can’t spelldance I suppose it doesn’t matter,” Robles said. “It would be a shame if we threw the glass shop away because you were afraid of Rennly. I’ll be there watching your back.” Robles made a furtive look and pulled out his knife. “With this.”
“I’m not afraid of Rennly,” Tomrin said stoutly, hearing the lie buzz in his left ear.
“Just his staff?” 
“Of it hitting me,” Tomrin said. “Repeatedly.” 
Robles laughed. “Killing you might get whatever it is out of his system.”
Tomrin laughed. “He hates you too.”
“Ah, probably true,” Robles agreed. “But for other reasons.”
They turned down the lane on the side of the festival grounds. “You might as well say, hello.” Tomrin said as they neared the Watersipper pavilion. He kept his voice low as the tents on the way sat largely dark. 
“And maybe drink some real tarsk with your father,” said Robles.
“And then start rumors about Daughters of Heaven?” Tomrin asked. “Real tarsk is powerful stuff.”
“Then maybe talk of False Daughters as well,” Robles said. “My aunt heard stories of one coming down off the hill once.” 
“To steal little children?” Tomrin said. “Yet no children here ever go missing. Isn’t that funny?” He tried to keep his voice light and airy but he couldn’t help but wonder if he himself wasn’t such a child Margretta was trying to steal away. He worried what it meant. He desperately wished he was free of her. She knew his secret somehow, and that meant others could.  
The Watersipper family tent glowed a weak orange through the canvas walls bringing back memories—some good, others bad. Tomrin opened his mouth. “Father,” he said. “It is me, Tomrin.”
“And Robarthles Kopendrus,” his friend added. “And at your service.” 
It was rare to hear Robles use what he claimed was his real name. Knowing someone’s full name gave you power over them, it was said. It was nonsense of course but after tonight it seemed almost anything could be possible here in Woolad, in the heart of superstition and fear. 🔖


Chapter 15: A Familiar Game
For his is the buzzing in your ears,  
A darkling voice within your soul.
		—From The Dark Verses

A shadow moved within the tent. It grew and filled it while Emy’s tent next door lay dark. She squealed from within the larger one. “Tomrin!” She had stayed up too. The large shadow shrunk to the size of a man and the shadow worked the strings. The flap flew open. Dable Watersipper peered out, he was himself little more than shadows. “Tomrin,” he said, reaching out to shake his hand. “You surprised us.” Tomrin hesitated only a fraction of a second before taking his father’s hand.
“Sorry to call on you so late, Dable,” Robles said as Dable shook his hand too. “But I brought your son safely with me, so I hope all is forgiven.”
Emy met them both at the flaps. She hugged Tomrin then Robles. Inside, Janet Watersipper waited. She wore a long white robe, same as Dable’s and Emy’s. She politely hugged them. “Your friend, Gaz,” she said. “His mother—”
Tomrin dropped his pack next to Robles’ pack. “Yes, Janet,” Robles said. “We heard. My aunty sent word right away; work kept us.” Tomrin admired the remarkable ease with which Robles stretched the truth. Work had kept them, yet that was not the only reason they were so late. 
He felt a stranger in his father’s tent. He’d shaken his father’s hand, and had hugged his mother and sister despite Margretta’s warning about how easy it would be for a Daughter of Heaven’s Glory finding him out. He felt his family was far too religious to be anything other than what they claimed.
“I was just lamenting not having a fourth for a good game of Pincushion.” Dable said. He rubbed his hand together as he eyed the two of them with his green orbs. 
“I don’t know,” Tomrin said. “It’s late.” 
“I have time for one game,” Robles said. “Single Dip?” 
“Double,” said Dable. “Takes more skill.” 
Robles didn’t argue with him and he, Dable, Tomrin and Emy sat down around a small lacquered travel table on cushions while Janet Watersipper continued her sewing. Dable removed cards from the table’s drawer as Robles sat opposite Tomrin; Emy sat opposite Dable. 
“Want to deal kings for teams?” Dable said as he shuffled.
“No need,” Robles said. “But I could really go for some tarsk. Can’t say that I didn’t build up a powerful thirst walking here from Menad.”
“This heat is something else, isn’t it?” Dable said as he riffled the cards. “Janet, some tarsk?”
“None for Emy,” Janet replied looking up from her sewing. 
Emy frowned. “I’m not too young for tarsk. Not for real tarsk.” 
“She can have a small shell,” Dable said.
“Fine, but only a small one,” Janet said. Standing, she served them.
Emy’s sad frown turned to a satisfied grin, which she turned on Robles who winked at her as he spilled a bit of his drink into her anemic cup of the milky fluid. Tomrin tipped a nip of his in as well before taking a sip. 
The bitterness of real tarsk was quite different from fake tarsk which the public houses sold from large wooden barrels. Real tarks numbed his lips and tongue and did not burn. Tomrin set his shell down and played his cards.
The rounds became more serious as they neared the end of the first hand. The playful banter ended, and only quick reminders broke the silence. It’s your play. I know. Who led? I did. 
Dable wasn’t sweating, but his shell of tarsk sat idle as Robles rolled his own shell in his free hand. It was Emy’s turn to play a card on Dable’s lead. Robles had sloughed. Now she didn’t know what to do. “I forgot,” she whined. “I think I miscounted.” 
“No cheating,” Janet Watersipper called from her sewing. Talking about the play was against the rules.
“I’m not cheating.” Emy said. 
Tomrin quickly counted his and Robles’ stack of cards. It was slightly less than he and Robles needed for an upset. “Dad’s play does look good,” he said, skirting the rules. It wasn’t a lie. The play was off suit, but the highest cards in it had found their way into her’s and Dable’s stack already.
“Think,” Dable commanded Emy. “You know what to do.” 
“No, I don’t, I can’t remember,” she said, and did the right thing anyway by sloughing. Soon the hand was over.
“I knew I couldn’t go any higher,” Dable said. “I had that one crow left over. And I snuck it home anyway.” He took a sip of his tarsk. “Ahh!” he said, savoring it. Then setting his shell down, he placed his and Emy’s pin into the cushion to mark their score. “So, how’s Menad? The furnaces still hot?”
“Master Lazoloth is dead,” Tomrin said. 
In the corner Janet made the sign of the tree, quietly to herself. 
“Dead?” Dable said. “What does that mean?”
Robles rifled the deck. Fip, fip, fip. “It means we are looking for money to keep the glassworks afloat.” 
“But without Master Laz?” Dable said. “Isn’t he the genius behind the operation?” 
Robles pointed the deck of cards at Tomrin. “We have a new glass master.” 
“Well, I’ll be a feather,” Dable said, swearing. “You really that good?” 
“Dable!” Janet chided. “No swearing. When’s his funeral, Robles?” she added before her husband could respond. 
“There will be no funeral, I’m afraid,” Robles said. “You can’t imagine it—I can’t believe it myself. Big Laz was marked with the Scales of Leviathan...all this time.” 
Janet signed herself again at the mention of the Leviathan’s Mark.
“How?” Dable asked.
“His house caught on fire,” Robles said.
“Oh, sweet dear Seasargus!” Janet said. 
It didn’t sound like a curse, yet in Tomrin’s mind it was. Dear Seasargus! All eyes on Robles, Tomrin discreetly rubbed his chest. It had started itching at the first mention of Master Laz. 
“You would have been proud of us,” Robles said. “Tomrin and I rescued him.” 
“But he still died?” Dable said, riffling the cards.  Fip, fip. “Yes?” Fip, fip.
 “Yes, but Rennly might be interested in helping finance the glassworks,” Robles said.
“Really?” Dable asked, dealing. 
“Not really,” Tomrin said. His own Pincushion hand was shaping up to be decent. “If I beat him at staves tomorrow, he said he’d pitch in.” 
“Really? Now that’s a bout I’d pay to see,” Dable said. “I taught you both staves, yet never a championship match between you.” 
“I’m not going to do it,” Tomrin said. He turned to Emy. “Bet is to you.”
“Me?”
“Yes, you, little lady. I was under,” Robles said. “So the bet’s to you.” The betting continued around.
“So the shop is broke?” Dable asked.
Tomrin pulled out his billfold. “We’re not exactly broke.” He pulled the paper bank draws from his billfold and set them down on the table, splaying them out like cards. “At least I’m not broke, even if the shop is,” he added and reached to pick up the notes.
Dable was faster; his free hand covered the notes. “Seventy,” he said.
Tomrin drew back his hand as Dable carefully squeezed the notes into a pile and picked them up. He inspected them one at a time.
“Seventy-five,” Tomrin said, raising him. Robles and Emy had both passed.
Dable set down the banknotes. “Not a small chunk of change,” Dable added. “Master Laz paid well.” 
“Maybe a little too well,” Robles said. 
Tomrin tucked the bills away. “Still less than we could make in Corundum. But, it is not about the pay when you talk about glass. It’s all about the upshot.” The term always struck Tomrin as oddly violent.
“That’s right,” Robles said. “And I am still passed.” 
“I’m passed as well,” Emy added.
“I think that is why Rennly wants in. He’s a betting man,” Robles said.
“Gambling,” Janet shook her head. 
“Luckily, the glass shop isn’t a gamble now,” Tomrin said. “I’ve managed to make the new telescope work better than ever.” Perhaps he was bragging but his father brought that out in him. It was something Janet liked to call them both on. For now, she let it slide. 
“Don’t ask your brother Hadras for money,” Dable said. “He’s had a bad year with this heat.” 
“Where is he?” Robles asked. “I didn’t see his tent. 
Emy answered. “He stayed behind with the flock.” 
“We only brought in the prized ones this year,” Dable said. “I plan to win. And I am passing.”
Tomrin began the play.
“Tomrin versus Rennly would be a good match, wouldn’t it?” Robles said as he played his own first card. 
Dable agreed when the play came around to him. “But gambling is out of the question,” he added, glancing at Janet. 
The play went forward, and the tricks required their attention. Emy and Robles gathered in trick after trick. 
“Rennly doesn’t understand glass like us,” Robles injected. “He understands horse flesh.” He glanced at Dable. “Like the way you understand wood and animals. That’s why he wants this bout.”
Dable cut in with a higher card. “So Rennly knows how to pick them?” 
“No doubt,” Robles replied. Tomrin gave up on the hand as Dable cut another trick. He began focusing on what was being said. He couldn’t help but think Robles was going somewhere with his words even as the cards were heading for an upset. “I saw his new horse,” Tomrin said. “A gray razor. Looks fast.” 
“Stepper is his name and he is fast,” Robles said. “I’m not saying I’ve been gambling at the races, but I’ve seen him run. The old boy has a good temper too.” 
“Good for him,” Dable said as the last trick of the hand was played. “You think Tomrin has a chance against him?” 
“Rennly just wants a good fight is all,” Robles said. “And I’m sure he’ll invest in the glass shop regardless.” 
“Really?” Dable said as Emy counted their points. “That’s the upset,” Dable added. He moved the pins in the pincushion. “You think so?” 
“He goes in—you go in?” Robles said. “Safer money that way. What do you say, Dable?” 
“I’d say I hope Tomrin is a better partner at glass than at Pincushion.” 
“I’d say,” Robles agreed, a nasty grin on his face.
“Sorry, I overbet my hand,” Tomrin said. “But I haven’t agreed to any of this.” 
“Not even to keep the glass shop going?” Dable asked. “What’s it called Godly Glass Shop?” 
“Works. Godly Glassworks.” Tomrin drank a sip of his tarsk. “I might not even face him, if I enter.”
“How many hours did you train?” Robles said. “You can show up this riff-raff; no question in my mind.” 
“I’m out of practice. Maybe a glassworking competition?”
“Then there would be no contest,” Robles retorted. 
Dable laughed. “He really that good?” 
“There are masters better than me in the world,” Tomrin said.
Dable drank a sip from his shell. “But not in Menad?” 
“Not in Menad,” Robles said. “Maybe not even in Corundum.” 
They started a new hand and played it out, then yet another before the miserable game was over.
“I’d love to stay and make it up,” Robles said. “But, one skunk is enough for me.” 
“The funeral in the morning, then the festival,” Emy said. “I need to go to bed.” 
“I need to find a bed as well,” Tomrin said standing. “The Old House Inn was full.” 
“You can have my bed,” Emy said. Robles began saying his goodnight to Janet. “I can sleep in here,” Emy added.
“You have a good sister,” Robles said as he shook Tomrin’s hand to leave.
“She’s not for sale.”
Emy slapped Tomrin’s shoulder. “Tomrin, don’t say stuff like that. You are embarrassing me.” 
“That’s what brothers are for,” Tomrin said. They showed Robles out as Dable began recounting their game to Janet. 
“Remember what I said,” Robles said, and nudging Tomrin’s toe.
“What about?” 
“Having to do the things we don’t want to.” 
“I remember.” 
 Robles bowed towards Emy. “Well, my good lady, against my better judgment I leave you with this lunk, and goodnight.” 
Tomrin and Emy said their own goodnights before Robles tracked off into the darkness, his pack on his back. 
Tomrin picked up his own pack and Emy led him by the star light to the entrance of her tent. She talked about the books she’d managed to read, and quoted lines at him. “If only I could find such a husband,” she said of one of the characters. Tomrin listened only with half an ear. His mind had wandered to Calena and the judge’s daughter. Netting either was a far more unlikely fantasy for him.
“I’m so happy you came, and so sad for you,” she said finally hugging him goodnight. 
“Why sad?” he asked, there was no way she could know what he was thinking. 
“Because of your friend Gaz. It’s just so sad, so tragic.” 
“Yes,” Tomrin agreed. “So pointless and tragic.” Thinking of Gaz made him think about Rennly and his abuse of his dead friend’s shade. 
“We missed you so much,” Emy said, then left him for the larger tent. The lamps had been turned down and Emy disappeared as she entered. 
Tomrin pushed his pack through the flap then ducked inside the smaller of the two Watersipper tents. Everything neatly arranged, inside smelled of myrrh from the match Emy had used to light the lamp. The bed was made prim, as his bed never was. Undressing, yet leaving his shirt on, he undid the linens and laid down to sleep.
Alone in the dark, the idea of having to fight Rennly twisted his guts. There had to be a different way. He racked his brain, wishing he could just tell Robles no. We’ll find another way. But what? Feathered gold, Tomrin swore to himself. Feathered Rennly. And the feathered Sapphire Front! They could all go choke on a feather. 
When sleep finally came, Tomrin dreamed of a beautiful woman who changed shape and color everytime he looked at her.🔖

Chapter 16: A Dirge 
Thus he spake and thus it was written,
Both on the earth as in the heavens.
	—From The Book of Light

Tomrin awoke with a start.  For a second he wondered if he was struck by lightning. Dry heat covered his body. The inside of his sister’s tent was dark, but not pitch black. The gray of predawn and the morning twilight outside blurred his vision as he stared up at the tent’s crossbar. The dying feeling slowly vanished. He couldn’t believe he’d slept. Though he tried he couldn’t recall his dreams. He closed his eyes, swearing he’d not slept near enough.
“Tomrin,” Dable said from outside. “Wake up.” Something batted the side of the tent. Wap.
“What?” Tomrin demanded. “Why?”
“You need to get up, we have to hurry.” 
Tomrin growled. “The funeral isn’t for hours,” he said. 
Dable rapped the tent wall again. Wap. “It’s still time to get up.”
“I’m up.” The regrowing mass in Tomrin’s chest throbbed with irritation. He remembered now why he hated staying with his parents. He stood up and opened the tent flaps. 
“And put some pants on,” Dable said, glancing down. His father wore his white robe. “And your boots.”
Tomrin suppressed the urge to tell his father to jump in the Lake of Fire. He had sworn at his father once before. It left him with a sense of unease for weeks. He hated the idea of such an incident occurring again.
He sat on Emy’s bed and pulled on the pants he’d shucked the night before. With a groan he stomped into his leather boots. The sky was growing brighter by the second. Hidden by tents, the sun rose in the west, yet the orange glow was there. The day would soon be hot. 
Tomrin suspected his father wanted him to help him with the animals but Dable grabbed a stick from where it leaned with a mate against the side of Emy’s tent. He handed it to Tomrin. “Here you go,” he said. “You remember this staff?” 
Tomrin did. He had made it at the carpentry shop long ago. He’d thought it lost. “Yes. Too heavy and too big.” It was made of oak and he had carved some feathers on it, but it remained unfinished. “It’s far too slow; useless from the weight, even if it didn’t have all the wrong play, no give.”
Dable took the other lighter staff in hand. “Follow me.”
“Why?” Tomrin asked, and let his staff’s butt down heavily. “What can we hope to accomplish?” 
“We can knock the rust out of your hinges,” his father said and led Tomrin to a corner of the campground where the ground was uneven and scattered with rocks. 
“This seems like a bad idea,” Tomrin said. “What about your knee?” 
“My knee isn’t going to fight Rennly today,” Dable said. “You just need to remember the basics.”
“I haven’t agreed to fight him,” Tomrin said.
Dable came with a slow, lumbering attack. Tomrin would have had no problem defending if his feathered staff wasn’t made of lead. For a minute they sparred. Dable delivered classic attacks, The Blacksmith’s Hammer and The Swan’s Sickle. Several of the attacks went through. The slap of wood hurt but only because Tomrin flinched, wrenching the wound on his chest.
“It looks like your hinges are totally rusted,” Dable said. He was a large man, and his face glistened from exertion. “Rennly is going to take you apart,” he said as leaned against his lighter staff. 
Tomrin breathed heavily and leaned on his own. “I never even liked mixing staves,” he said and headed back towards the tent and wagons. The sun’s light pressed down, heavy and hot against his back.
Dable caught up with him. “Last night, your mother and I decided we’d help you and the glass shop, but only if Rennly does.”
“Great. Thanks,” Tomrin said.
“It is called Godly Glassworks, isn’t it? With a censor there, your mother feels there would be nothing wrong with it.”
Before Tomrin could say more, Dable’s was passing out blessings to others in the campgrounds as if he were Seasargus himself. Outside the family tent, Tomrin asked his father in a low tone. “Why?” It was a broad question, but Tomrin thought it was clear enough. He knew his mother and father. If money was being spent, it was because Dable wanted it. “You don’t need to be mixed up in this.”
“I want to see you do well,” Dable replied. “And if I make a little more gold because of it, Seasargus won’t mind.”
“And not because Rennly is my half-brother?”
“He is, but should you mention that in front of your mother?” Dable said, turning away.  “Now you should get dressed.’
Once done muttering a string of swears while dressing, Tomrin headed back to the family tent. The flaps were tied open. He ducked to enter. His mother was serving Dable breakfast with Emy’s help. They all wore white robes. On their arms were tied yellow and blue ribbons. His mother eyed him critically. “Tomrin, you can’t wear that to the funeral,” he said. 
“The colors are way off,” Emy added.
Tomrin walked over to the squat table. “They are close enough for me,” he said sitting.
“Don’t be arrogant, Tomrin,” his mother said as she set a tin tray of cut apples and cheese in front of him. 
Emy set a cup of water next to his plate. “We have an extra robe for you,” she said. “And stripes.” 
“After food,” Dable said. He led their prayer once Janet and Emy sat down to eat. 
Tomrin ate his dried apple slices and  cheese made from goat milk. Both were strong and savory, nothing like the decadent breakfasts Mistress Fallon served in Menad. 
When they finished, his mother found him a robe, one from her own chest. “Put this one on,” she said, “I’ll find the extra stripes.” 
By the time he was dressed to his mother’s and Emy’s liking, Tomrin was lost in thought, trying to place exactly when everything began to sour. “The green glow,” he muttered. 
“What?” Emy asked him, pausing her own chatter for a moment. 
“Oh, nothing,” Tomrin replied.
Emy continued on about her dream from the night before. Dable returned and they headed for the temple. 
Near the temple, the stream of yellow and blue clad mourners pooled up until the flow through the door all but stalled. Orish families, tall, wide and rough looking—even in their mourning garb—loomed over little old Rubish women. Their once fresh faces were now ashen with age. A small number of ruddy skinned Peregrine men, women, and children swirled amongst the mourners; the same with the Orioles.
Suddenly, a group of censors parted the crowd; Rennly marched at their head. They didn’t have to say a word. Out of fear or respect, people retreated before the black clad men in silk suits. Batons wagged at every hip; they were Orioles to a man, clearly from Menad and Zircos before that. By some cruel luck they lived while Big Laz and Gaz were dead. The injustice of it burnt in Tomrin’s heart. 
One of the men laughed as they neared the door. Emy spoke quietly in Tomrin’s ear, but he lost the thread of her meaning. His anger simmered, not too hot, not too cold. Nothing to be done, he told himself. Maybe time was an illusion as the Luster promised. Yet Master Laz and Gaz were still dead, and tragically so. Laz, if not Gaz, was a visionary. These men, though, without their bludgeons, what were they? Nothing but Margretta’s black maggots.
Master Laz wasn’t the Lightshy Crow. He was a man, not a carrion eater. You should be the Lightshy Crow. The thought fluttered through Tomrin’s mind. It was just the Luster talking and he pushed the thought down even as his heart quickened. Am I a fool to think of Lady Margretta’s offer? The raw power of the gift would make him great and terrible. He would not fear Rennly. He would fear nothing.
Emy touched his arm. “Sad for Gaz?” she said. “We all are.”
Tomrin wiped the angry tears from his eyes. “Yes,” he said, “And for Master Laz. I should have done more.”
“You did everything you could.”
Tomrin sniffed, swallowing saltiness. “I know.” He didn’t like lying to his sister. He had no qualms about lying to his father or mother, but with Emy it was different. “Before the explosion I could have done more.” 
“You can’t beat yourself up over it.” 
“I know,” Tomrin said. “That’s Rennly’s job.” 
Emy suppressed a laugh, making a squeaking noise. “You’re going to enter the competition?”
“No,” Tomrin said. “I don’t know...a woman, a lady, she said she could help us.” 
“With money for the shop?” 
“I mean, I—”  He wanted to say but was afraid.
Emy made a face, as if thinking. “The new glass shop will succeed,” she said. “I have faith in you.”
They reached the doors and ushers showed them to their seats. When Tomrin stole a glance around he realized he recognized many of the people despite it having been years since he’d been inside the Woolad temple. 
On the altar, Gaz’s rectangular coffin lay covered in a red velvet pall. Members of his family and their owners, an older Rubish couple, Master and Mistress Clivent sat in the first row. Behind them were Rennly and the other censors. The people who Tomrin didn’t recognise seemed out of place, their blues and yellows as strained as his own tan pants and blue-gray shirt had been earlier. Outsiders. One year there had been rumors Jarvis himself would put in an appearance for the festival. It never happened. “Lookers-on,” he said to Emy in a whisper.
“What?” she asked back.
 But Tomrin didn’t respond. Dable hushed him, and Janet gave them both a look as the temple buzzed with the dull sound of boredom. A cough from the balcony turned Tomrin’s head. The choir was dressed in white and streamers on their arms. Robles grinned down and flipped his streamers at Tomrin and mouthed something. Tomrin couldn’t understand what he was saying and after shaking his head, he gave up and looked away. 
Bethany Karlite, missed on his first perusal, had sat on Tomrin’s left. Feathers. Of course she was here. Tomrin had no time to think how she always made him feel so awkward. The cantor and two altar boys entered. 
The three wore no yellow or blue mourning bands, but cords of red-dyed silk about their waists. The boys held censers wafting smoke. The cantor, however, held up a gold-painted shepherd’s crook. Were it solid gold, and not wood like the conceit, it would weigh a ton. The incense struck Tomrin strange, not one he could place. Slowly, the murmur of errant whispers ceased and the cantor began to chant. 
Tomrin drifted in his thoughts. Sluggishly he kept his eyes open as sleep tugged at his mind. Nothing the cantor said hadn’t been said before and with more passion. The man’s words began to drone as the service crawled to its inevitable conclusion.
When the service was all but finished, the casket with Gaz’s body was carried to the side door then to the burial yard by his surviving relatives. The front of the temple emptied pew-by-pew as the congregants joined the cantor, his altar boys, and Gaz’s family outside on the brown grass. They lowered the casket into the dry earth. 
Bethany stood so close to Tomrin that her scent cut through the smell of dried earth and lingering incense. Bethany Karlite. She was like a dark presence in his skull. Rennly and the other censors stood on the other side of Gaz’s grave. Rennly’s smiled when his dark green eye lit on Bethany. She shrugged.
Robles and the choir, now outside, sang as shovel-loads of dirt dropped onto the coffin. The spade passed from person to person, first to Gaz’s mother then to his step-father then to his two-half-brothers, both taller and thinner than Gaz, their hair thinning on top exposing their short, upswept ears. Finally, Gaz’s youngest sister handed the shovel to Rennly. Her eyes were red but she moved unblinking as if in a daze, the youngest duckling in a clan of stunned ducks.
When it was his turn, Rennly attacked the dirty pile with the shovel. Chlank. Pebbles of rock and dirt clattered on the wooden coffin. He handed the shovel to Tomrin. For a second their eyes locked. Feathers, Tomrin cursed to himself after making sense of why Rennly held onto the shovel an extra second—he wasn’t going to let things go.
Then the service was over with a dirge. Men and women exited the temple, their voices raised much louder than the earlier clamor. The funeral was over. Seasargus be praised! The thought was not entirely ironic. It was just one more thing out of dozens the cantor had said. Gaz was still dead, still insensate. There was nothing but empty platitudes and false hope for him now. 
Sadness choked Tomrin as he and Emy and Dable and Janet headed out the same doors they had first entered. He forced himself to breathe even as Emy cried in the landing area outside the temple. Everyone talked freely now. Dable spoke with Gaz’s family; Tomrin wished only to be away from their pain.
When Robles joined Tomrin, he and Dable headed back to the campground with Emy and Janet. Dable talked about the cantor. “The man sermonized worse than ever. I don’t know where he gets these things. So outside!”
Tomrin wasn’t sure what his father’s problem was with the cantor’s views. “The music was good,” he said, turning to Robles, “You raised a pleasing sound to the heavens.” 
Robles licked his lips like a hot dog. “I can howl with the best of them,” he said. No longer in his white choir robe, Robles had his pack on his back.
“You had some competition on the ground,” Dable said. 
“I did?” 
“He means Rennly,” Tomrin said. 
“He’s a decent singer, I suppose, for someone with no training.” 
“He seemed to be good at what he does,” Dable said. “Maybe Tomrin is wise to avoid him in the ring.” 
“Well it’s too late for that,” Tomrin said. “It’s already been decided.”
Dable clapped him on his back. “That’s my boy!” 
“What tipped the scales?” Robles asked. 
“Rennly. He’s determined to do something. I may not be good at the staves anymore—but I once was.”
“So time to toss the dice?” Dable said.
“I suppose,” Tomrin said. “But I still hate gambling. It’s not me, but Rennly forcing me to do this.” 
“At least you know staves,” Robles said. “Plus when a feral dog bites you, sometimes your only hope is to bite back.”🔖


Chapter 17: Sheep Shearing Days
Such is the crow—
And such is the light, 
And such is the feeling 
He gets every night!
	—A Rubish nursery rhyme

Tomrin set down his tin. He and Robles were eating their scones at the Bachman Bakery booth. “Rennly,” Tomrin said, nodding at Rennly. He and two censors approached on the white quartz path.
“If you’re worried,” Robles said, smacking his lips. “Maybe we should practice a bit.” 
“No. I mean, here he comes,” Tomrin said. “And I’ve already practiced.”
“Then time to work our magic,” Robles said, washing his fingers with water from his tin.
“More like your magic,” Tomrin said. “I leave this to you.” 
“Tomrin Watersipper and Robles Kopendrus, Woolad’s prodigal sons,” Rennly said to his fellow censors. 
Robles bowed, still sitting at the table. “And at your service.”
“Robles, why don’t you show these two around,” Rennly said without bothering to introduce them. “Tomrin and I have business to discuss.” 
“But I am his business partner,” Robles said. “How would that work?”
“You don’t trust him?” Rennly asked, sweeping his hands in dismissal. “I’m sure he’ll tell you all about our little conversation.” 
“Robles stays,” Tomrin interjected. 
Rennly’s green eyes gleamed. “Then I guess we have nothing to discuss,” he said, adjusting his shirt. His golden feather badge glinted in the sun.
Robles stood. “Of course I trust him. I would be delighted to show your friends around. Maybe a quick game of darts?” Robles led the two censors down the path. “A small wager on the outcome?”
As Robles and the two censors left, the lawyer Marten stepped past them on the quartz walkway. What’s he doing here? Tomrin wondered. If he was here then the woman with the ruby hair had to be close. The idea of a False Daughter here threatened to unnerve him. The large Orish man headed straight for the scone ordering window. 
Rennly sat down in Robles’ vacated seat.
“Where is Daughter Calena?” Tomrin asked, thinking to toss Rennly off his own line of questioning.
“She decided to head home to Menad,” Rennly said. “The food at the Old House Inn disagreed with her this morning.” Rennly picked up Robles’ tin and took a drink. “One of the sauces.”
“You sick?” 
“If only you were that lucky,” Rennly said. “But no, I didn’t have any.” Rennly’s eyes flashed and for a second they glowed with insanity.
“I don’t rely on luck,” Tomrin said. “I bet on sure things.” 
“So you don’t want the gold?” Rennly said. 
“I didn’t say that,” Tomrin said quickly, wishing Robles had stayed. “You want this bout. You clearly want to prove something.” 
“I have nothing to prove,” Rennly replied. The large Orish man, Marten, took his scone loaded with jelly from the delivery window and, seemingly intent on it, sat silently down on a bench behind Rennly.
Tomrin pursed his lips. “What is it then? Vengeance?” he asked. “Or is it envy?” 
Rennly scoffed, “I don’t even know what you are talking about.” 
“Something is driving you, Rennly? What is it? Whatever it is, it is not going to turn out well. You need to give it up...for your own good.” 
“My own good?” Rennly asked. “Since when have you had a thought of anyone, but for yourself? You aren’t even sad Gaz is dead.”
“We shouldn’t do this, Rennly,” Tomrin said. He swept his hand towards the path and the way towards the staves. “It is dangerous. Not just for us, but for others.”
“Others?” Rennly asked. He smacked his lips and licked his teeth. “What’s to keep you from running off and sticking me with your precious glass shop? That’s my concern.” Rennly seemed almost bored.
“I talked to my father this morning,” Tomrin said, stalling. Me the untrustworthy one?
“What about?” Rennly asked.
“We talked about things… He’s watched your progression with interest. Just as he watches mine. And this—” Tomrin swirled his hand through the air. “—all this is not healthy for you. You need to let it go.”
“Dable said that?”
“Not in so many words.”
Rennly scoffed. “You are just telling stories. You want to hear one of mine?” 
“Feathers,” Tomrin swore. Marten’s ears didn’t quite perk up, but the Orish man raised his right eyebrow.
“You know where we went after Davot died?”
“West.”
“Yes,” Rennly said. “We moved first to the Emerald Forest. My mother took me to see an old woman. You know the kind?” 
“Do I?” Tomrin asked. He wasn’t sure where Rennly was going with all this, but he was afraid he knew all too well. 
“She was strange, beyond strange,” Rennly said. “Her hut was a wreck of bones and twigs. She looked like she was on the verge of death and mad as a crow. Her own bones poked through her yellow skin. She claimed she could see the future in the lines in my hands.” Rennly rubbed a thumb across his palm. “I have one thing, and only one thing to fear, she said.” Rennly balled his fists on the table. 
“Really?” Tomrin asked. “What was it?” 
Rennly snorted a laugh, “Ha. She said I had only to fear the Lightshy Crow.” Rennly all but wheezed as he laughed at Tomrin’s discomfort.
“Makes sense,” Tomrin said when Rennly finally composed himself. “It’s the only thing I fear—myself.” Myself? Tomrin wondered at the slip of his own tongue. 
“I don’t believe in such things,” Rennly said. “You’re afraid to fight me. I see that. You’re afraid I might slip and hurt you? The fear is in your eyes. So I ask you who is the coward now?”
An unpleasant thrill shot through Tomrin as his words came out Rennly’s mouth, echoing his own from so long ago. “Not I—despite my misgivings,” he said. “I submit a wager to you on the outcome.”
“A wager?” Rennly said. “What are you even saying?”
“What I am saying is, I’m entering the staves competition,” Tomrin said and he held up a finger. “But win or lose, you buy in.”
“That’s quite the wager. Win or lose!” Rennly said. He turned and spat into the dirt, before turning back to the table. “And what guarantee do I have that you’ll even try? 
“Barring a dark horse you know we’ll see each other in the final ring.”
“That’s not good enough.” Rennly said, his eyes green hard as chert. “How about this, and because I want to see what you’re made of, I propose—” 
“If for some reason we don’t meet in the champion’s ring,” Tomin quickly offered. “We will have our own bout—just you and me.” 
Rennly made a thoughtful sound in his throat. “No,” he said. “We’ll have remedial bouts—regardless of whether we meet. If you don’t win, we will have another bout, and another until you do.” 
Tomrin made a noise. His idea had been a good one, but Rennly had just twisted it. “That won’t work.”
“Sure, it will. After work—I will find you or send word to come to the temple—you could use more prayer in your life anyway.” 
“Only until I beat you?” Tomrin said, stalling and afraid to offer anything more for fear Rennly would twist it too. 
“That’s right.” 
“Fine,” Tomrin said, “And you will cover operations, payable every month. Automatic transfers until the glassworks ends its draws?” 
“Equity for every draw,” Rennly said pointing at the table. 
“Naturally. But no control.” 
Rennly pointed to his badge. “You forget I have powers no matter what. The power of censure.” 
“Only that.” 
“I think every night might be too often,” Rennly mused. “Maybe the first week or so. To whip you into shape. To help you remember your Peregrine blood.”
“Rennly,” Tomrin tsked. “Such petty barbs? Look around. Your friends aren’t here to snicker.”
Marten stood and walked over as Robles and Rennly’s censor friends just then returned. Several other groups began packing into the bakery’s pavilion. From her pack of friends, Emy waved discreetly.
“I...you—” Marten said, gesturing at Tomrin. “I saw you in Menad. I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation.” 
“Best you forget it then,” Rennly said, irritated at the interruption.
“I will do that,” Marten replied as Robles and the two censors walked into the tents’ shade. “I can also offer my services...as an advocate. I do contracts on the side.” The man straightened his vest.
Tomrin wanted to ask the man if he was following him, or was he following the dark lady? “We worked out the details,” he said to Robles.
“Well, not exactly,” Marten said. “If you want, I can help fill them in. Then I can write and file the contract—so it’s official.” 
“What are the details? A deal is struck?” Robles asked, looking pleasantly astonished at the speed.
“Yes, and if—” Rennly raised a hand to Marten. 
“Counselor Marten, no esquire—”
“Obviously,” Rennly said. The man was Orish and was technically a slave. He could hold no title, not in Corundum, not anywhere. 
“Obviously,” Marten said easily, and not waiting for Rennly to say more, he continued. He outlined the deal, adding dates and party-this and party-that, and herefores seemingly at random, but what he said was largely what Rennly agreed to. “And I can write it up for you to sign for a small fee.” 
Robles and Marten huggled over the fee. “And I want it before the staves is over,” Robles added. 
“Done,” Marten replied. “Now if you excuse me, I have a spot of work to do; here is overcrowded.” He left the pavilion at a dignified pace. 
Rennly wore a wry smile. “You worked him down for my benefit?” 
“Money will not be wasted here, at Godly Glassworks.” Robles said with a bow. “But if you will excuse me, it seems Tomrin and I have a bit of a bout to prepare for.”
“Yes,” Rennly said with a mocking bow of his own. “Let’s make it a good one.”
“I can’t help feeling I’m getting into bed with an asp,” Tomrin said to Robles as he signed and paid the woman behind the counter the entry fee for the staff competition.
“Can we borrow a couple of staves to practice with?” Robles asked, shining her his brightest smile. “Mistress Gorkel?” 
“Against the rules,” she replied. Tightly curled hair ringed her stony face. 
“But—” 
“No, Master Robles,” she snapped. “The rules are the rules.” 
“I have staves back at the tent,” Tomrin said. 
“Good, I’d hate to break any rules, or anything,” Robles said darkly.
Mistress Gorkel sniffed. 
“She ate a sour apple,” Tomrin said as they headed out of the pavilion leaving the clack, clack of artlessly wielded staves and the generous calling of points—point yellow, point blue—behind. The youth competition was in full swing.
At the Watersipper tent, Tomrin picked up the two staves leaned against it. “Hello, Janet,” Robles said, ducking his head inside the tent. 
“Hello, Robles,”  she replied. “Tomrin is at the festival.” 
“Actually, I have him here with me.”
“Hello Mother,” Tomrin said through the canvas. They headed for the rocky break in the tents.
“This is great,” Robles said. “Not mine. Yours. That colossal heap isn’t good, but it looks great.” 
Tomrin jabbed. “Like thrusting a pig.”
Robles countered his swing low—and stayed low. Clut. He spun, a nonsense move, but it hid his staff and, instead of attacking freely, Tomrin balked. 
Robles struck him on the thigh.  Tuck. What seemed like a quick swing was a trap. “That wasn’t supposed to work,” Robles said. “And point for me.”
Tomrin rubbed his ankle. “One. Zero. Not looking good.”
“So what did you and Rennly talk about?”
“Nothing. You know he’s my brother, right?”
“Yes,” Robles said. “The poor guy. I bet you humiliate him by holding back.”
They traded a couple of swipes. Clut, clut. Sweat began to bead on Tomrin’s head. “It’s like you should be the one to fight him,” he said, rubbing his sweaty forehead with the back of his index finger.
“You’re going to need a sweatband,” Robles said.
Dable walked over. 
Tomrin glanced at the sun. It had moved. Instead of being a hot glare in the east, it was now a hot, red glare high above. “We lost track of time,” Tomrin said, handing his staff to his father. “I need water.” 
Dable led him and Robles back to the tent. “You also need something to keep the sweat from your eye’s,” Dable said as Janet poured water for them. “You can’t be swatting sweat and expecting to win.” 
“We know that,” Tomrin said, wondering about his chance of actually winning, of actually beating Rennly. “I just need a handkerchief.” 
“A streamer?” Janet offered, holding up a yellow streamer. 
“No,” Dable said, “Can’t be yellow or blue.” 
“What can’t be yellow or blue?” Emy asked, darkening the tent’s opening. She ducked in. A young Orish girl as big as an ox followed her inside. 
“My head band,” Tomrin said. “I need a handkerchief.” 
“Oh, I have one,” Emy said and headed outside, leaving the large girl with a “stay here.” 
Tomrin cringed at Kam’s awkwardness but Robles spoke. “Doing well, Kam?” He reached out a hand to the girl and walked over to her. “I heard you singing.” 
Kam took Robles’ hand and shook. “Thank you, Master Robles. I heard you too.”
“Everyone heard Robles,” Dable said with a wry grin. Tomrin grinned and nodded but hid his own smile in a drink of water. 
Emy returned with a white head scarf, cashmere embroidered with a black swan in flight. Its neck, over a golden sun, bent as if looking for a place to land. “I made it myself,” she said, as she handed it to Tomrin. He began folding it up.
Robles snatched it from him. “Fold it right,” he said, snapping the cloth and folding it so the sun and swan sat centered. “Turn around.” Tomrin complied and Robles tied the handkerchief around his head. 
“We better hurry,” Dable said, as Emy began peppering Kam with words. Tomrin smiled and glanced at a grinning Robles. They left the tent with Emy whining, not knowing what was so funny.
At the staves, the second place winner in the children’s competition walked off before receiving his red ribbon and had to be called back to the ring. “And don’t run off,” Miss Gorkel said. “Anyone can win best-in-show. Even second place.” That was unlikely; best-in-show always seemed to go to the blue ribbon holder in the children’s competition.
Robles waved Rennly over.
“Don’t tell me you are backing out,” Rennly said. 
“Not at all,” Robles replied. “We wanted to make sure you weren’t.” 
“As if I am the one afraid?” Rennly said with a self-satisfied smirk. 
“I’m not afraid,” Tomrin said, feeling a surge in his heart rate. He turned to Robles. “I’m hungry.” 
“Yes, food!” 
They headed back through the crowd. Five bouts stood ahead of Tomrin’s first, and two before Rennly’s. “We need to get back to see his bout,” Tomrin said. 
“And I need to make my other tosses in the knife throw. Rennly entered there too.” 
“At least one of us will beat him,” Tomrin said, trying to look on the bright side.
There was a nervous energy at the Farmers’ Stock and Feed tent where the supply store hosted lunch for one silver a plate. Tomrin sat down with his lamb chops. He quickly found himself missing Rennly’s company. For all his faults, he was better than the superstitious Orish man to his left. While Tomrin wished for Robles help, he had his own trouble in the shape of a Rubish matron wanting to discuss the demon’s role in this drought and how it had impacted the price of their meager meal. 
Tomrin’s Orish man spoke of strange going-ons. “Just last night—” The man eyed Tomrin with his dull orbs; he lowered his voice. “—a False Daughter came by the graveyard out yonder butte and brought all the dead back, straight to life to roam and haunt. Gives me chills to think of it. I tell you that. It’s what this world is coming to.” 
Tomrin had no option but to agree. When he finished his lamb, he barely remembered having tasted it. He headed back to the ring at a near run, leaving Robles to fend for himself. 
Rennly had taken to the ring against an Orioles man who looked like his uglier cousin, more hardened by the sun. Tough living brought out the man’s spots. While older than Rennly, his age had not made him craftier with the staff. 
“Point Blue. Point Blue.” The referee called as Rennly slapped the man around the ring like the simple farmer he was. The man lost quickly but with a grin on his face. Tomrin heard him tell another man who could have been his dumber looking brother: “Least I lost to Rennly Rickot, him all dressed in black I was afraid to really open up. Fear of the Gods and all. Better than some puffed up slave.” 
Tomrin scoffed quietly to himself. There wasn’t going to be enough drink left over in the tarsk tent by the time the competition was over. He congratulated Rennly with a nod and went in search of Robles or maybe even Councilor Marten—anyone with a brain not trying to brain him.🔖


Chapter 18: A Feathered Thing
For he shall become one with his sword. 
And with it he shall unravel the cosmos.
	—From The Dark Verses

Robles’ knife sank into the target’s bullseye with a hollow thud. Tomrin ducked under the cordon. The game master recorded and retrieved Robles’ knife to the polite claps of onlookers. The knife had hit the center but not dead center. “What’s the matter?” Tomrin asked Robles. The toss wasn’t even a far one. “How are you missing?”
Robles grinned at him. “I’m not,” he said, wiggling his eyebrows in a conspiratorial way. He was up to something. “I have an idea. It came to me when I realized I could be up against Rennly as well.” 
“Oh?” Tomrin said, “What are you thinking?”
Robles didn’t respond instantly. He waited for the recorder to return his knife. “You’ll see, if you lose.” 
“I could still win,” Tomrin replied and headed behind the audience line at the recorder’s behest. Rennly was still beatable—unless he was holding back like Robles. Tomrin dismissed the idea and thought it would be nice to beat Rennly after everything, after all the petty slights and thrown dirt clods. Robles tossed his twenty-paces knife throw. Thufh. 
“What are you doing here?” Rennly asked in Tomrin’s right ear. “The Gorkles are calling your name.” 
Tomrin swung about to glance at Rennly. “Feathers,” he muttered as he pushed through the crowd. He didn’t turn around to see if Rennly or his goons followed until he reached the pavilion; they hadn’t.
Tomrin checked in with Miss Gorkel. “You are supposed to be here when your name is called,” the referee told him as he tied the yellow ribbon on his arm, a breach of protocol but Tomrin wasn’t going to say anything other than his first sorry. He stole a look at his opponent. The man, with his wife, was comforting his young son, barely more than a toddler. The man’s blue steamer was already tied in place. The referee called them to the ring and the man handed his unhappy son to the woman.
Tomrin squared off with the young Rubish father. They bowed over their staves. Tomrin’s staff felt light after the oak one; he jabbed with the butt, making the first move. The man countered, hesitating slightly. He was not the dark horse Rennly feared. Tomrin, however, recognized him finally. Foby Doormaker had been to the carpentry shop on several occasions. Older than Tomrin’s  brother Hadrus by a year or two, he had been friendly. As his staff touched Foby’s chest, legs and arms, Tomrin made sure not to hurt him.
The referee called out the points as they traded blows, but the match grew lopsided with Foby’s staff only striking Tomrin across the forearm and thigh for two points. Foby sweated heavily when the ten point spread was breached.
Tomrin bowed over his staff to Foby and shook his hand. “Good match,” he said. He adjusted the sweat band on his forehead. It was soaked with sweat. 
“I don’t know,” Foby wheezed. “You took me apart.” 
Tomrin rubbed his arm. “You got in a couple of good ones too.” 
Foby smiled and then thanked Tomrin for going easy on him. The man walked out the ring rubbing his chest—massaging the only strike that really connected. His wife handed him back his son. The woman seemed more relieved than anything. 
Dable stood with Rennly and Robles. Tomrin returned his streamer and staff then headed over to them as the clerk called out the names of the next two contestants.  Dable clapped his hand on Tomrin. “That was a good bout!” he said. “Now I need to check on the animals.” 
“I hope you take it that easy on me,” Rennly said. But it was clear what he meant, when he added: “Not sure I have the same level of control.” 
“Just don’t break his fingers,” Robles said. “We need those for working the glass.” 
“Don’t you two have knives to throw at each other?” Tomrin asked, not looking forward to his fated match with Rennly. 
“And that is why we don’t let Tomrin touch sharp things,” Robles said. “He hasn’t quite got the idea down yet.” 
Tomrin jabbed a finger at Robles’ chest. “Pointy end goes in here.” 
“Right,” Robles said, and turned to Rennly. “We should get back to it.” 
“Worried, Robles?” Rennly asked.
“Worried? Nothing but my pride on the line, so of course I’m worried!” Robles’ hysterics sounded real. But he was up to something. He’d already admitted as much.
Back at the knife throw, others tossed knives while Robles and Rennly watched and waited. Rennly acted cool, calm, and in control, confident of success at both, though he did hurry back to the staff competition as it was close to time for his second match. “I don’t want to be late like someone we know,” he said as he slipped away.
“It’s going to be a nightmare having Rennly around.” Tomrin said. The man was worse than his mother, always finding fault. 
“Hmm,” Robles grunted. “It won’t be that bad. And if it is, we can always kill him.”
“A pleasant thought,” Tomrin said. “But, no. I hope your plan works. Killing a censor, even Rennly, would never do.” 
Robles grinned. “It won’t come to that.”
“Let’s hope,” Tomrin said, and headed to the Gorkel tent. The throbbing mass of knotted evil in his chest seemed to grow by the minute. Despite the people all around him, he felt isolated by it and alone.
At the staff pavilion, Rennly made his second win seem so effortless; it was as if it came naturally. The next few bouts flew by. Amateurs. 
Robles returned. Rennly walked over as Dable came from the animal pens, in his hands a blue ribbon, the satin of it shining in the westing sun. “The fun is not over is it?” he asked, beaming, seeming overly pleased with himself.
“Not yet, Master Watersipper,” Rennly said. 
“First place, she-goat,” Robles read off the ribbon.
Rennly added his own warmth. “Congratulations, Dable.” 
The announcer called Tomrin’s name, and because he spent an extra moment congratulating his father, he wasn’t able to select the staff he wanted, the same from the first round. The one he picked was nearly identical. The difference bugged him. And it bugged him that it bugged him. Feathered superstitions! The smooth yew staff in his hand was every bit as good as his opponent’s.
Capal Tassas swirled the thing for his Orish friends then swung it like a woodcutter chopping wood. The yew howled through the air. Kwoof. He turned to face off with Tomrin, swinging as he stepped into the ring. Grinning wickedly, he continued to pulverize the air. Kwoof. Kwoof, kwoof. He paused to speak. “I’ll try not to hurt you—not too bad,” Capal said. 
“I’ll try not to as well,” Tomrin said and bowed. Capal grunted a laugh and lashed out. He struck Tomrin a quick blow to the arm. “Point blue!” 
Capal, and his staff, forced Tomrin to pay close attention. Woof-flack! The Orish man attacked, his staff raised like a blacksmith’s hammer. His next swing was off-balance and poorly executed. Woof-tunt. The whiff of his staff rustled the hair on Tomrin’s arm as he let the blow go by his side to the ground. Tomrin, slapped the man’s middle. Fwap, then spun to deflect a counter stroke. Point yellow. The man’s friends laughed.
Angry strength made no match of it after that; the fight was essentially over. Clack, fwap. Clack, fwap. “Hold still you little rat,” Capal muttered angrily as Tomrin delivered the tenth point for yellow.
Soon after that the referee called “Match. Yellow.” Capal had only touched him once and that was his sneak attack and it was a glancing blow at best. He would not win best-in-show.
“Now, they fight for third place,” Tomrin said after he joined Dable, Robles, and Rennly in the crowd. 
“Hmm, yes,” Rennly agreed. “No dark horse to upset our little game.” 
The lawyer Marten walked over. The big Orish counselor held his leather satchel. “Gentleman,” he said. 
“Who’s this?” Dable asked. 
“Dable,” Robles said, “Meet Counselor Marten from Menad. Marten, Dable Watersipper, Tomrin’s father.” 
Marten bowed again as Dable’s hands remained at his side. Dable disliked Orish men. “Not from Menad, but still a pleasure,” Marten said. “And gentlemen, your contract is ready for your perusal and signing.” He tapped his satchel with a meaty hand. 
“We need a table,” Tomrin said, rubbing his first welt.
“I could certainly go for another scone,” Robles said. “All this fun is hungry work.”
Dable led the way. The rest of the party made a parade behind him as they walked the quartz path to Bachman Bakery’s booth. Each paid their own way at the window. Tomrin ordered a scone with raspberry jelly without currants—unlike his father who asked for extra. After they polished off their snacks, Tomrin glanced around. It was like he and the others were an exhibit. People goosenecked when Marten pulled out the papers and a small inkwell with a quill from his satchel. “Read it if you want,” the Orish man said. “But as an impartial source, you may trust everything is in order—and fair.”
An older Rubish gentleman walked over. “And what are you fellers up to?”
Tomrin had met the man before, but had since forgotten his name. The man had once wanted some woodwork done by Dable. Tomrin had forgotten what exactly. What Tomrin did remember was his father calling the minor lord a gossip and a miser. Yet that had not stopped Dable from taking the job.
“Seems the boys have a bit of a bet going on with the staves, Nuttel,” Dable said, not adding the man’s honorific. “Big money is riding on it.” 
“Actually, there’s no money—” Tomrin said, correcting his father.
Robles stopped him, swatting air and grimacing. “Nothing’s riding on the staves,” he said. “But this is a big money contract for Godly Glassworks in Menad.” 
“Glass?” Nuttel snorted. “Tin’s good enough for me. I see no need for fancy glass. Just going to break anyhow.”
“That just means repeat business,” Robles replied smoothly. 
“I suppose it does,” Nuttel said, thoughtfully. “If only it wasn’t all a bunch of sorcery.”
The man tottered off, pushing through the aisle of benches and people, muttering to himself.
Tomrin was happy to see the man leave. “Let’s just sign this nonsense and get it over with,” he said.
“Settle down,” Robles told him. Clearly none of this was getting to him. It was like Robles enjoyed it. But then again, he wasn’t the one Rennly was schooling with the others.
“If you aren’t going to sign, I will,” Tomrin said and snatched up the quill. “Hand me the paper.” 
“The contract,” Marten said, sliding it to him.
The man’s script was large and flowing; Tomrin couldn’t focus on it. He found his name at the bottom of the page and scratched his signature with the quill then dropped it back into the inkwell. “I’ll meet you in the ring,” he said to Rennly then turned and left the tent.
As he walked past a couple of strapping young Rubish bucks he realized he was frustrated and angry. You can’t be angry, he told himself. He’d read that was how the evil inside got you. Anger, the tract said, was how the evil tricked you, and once used, there was no hiding from the Daughters, or censors, or the Serath. I’m a good person, Tomrin told himself, desperately wanting to believe it. 
By the time he signed in at the staves pavillion, the anger was gone but now a nervous energy filled him. He played out several scenarios in his head. Some he beat Rennly; others he lost. Most others.
In the ring, two men fought for a shot at third place, possibly second. They sparred, and though Tomrin watched, he did not see them. 
The festival and its people moved. They lived and they enjoyed themselves. Their voices, their laughter, their calls to one another like handsome birds on a fine spring day, washed over him, unheard. Their lives, their words, and their world were outside his understanding.
“Going to win?” Robles said. 
Tomrin started, his revelry broken. He planned on leaving as soon as the competition was over. He could be all alone in Menad as well as here. “I don’t know,” he said. “I feel like beating Rennly into the dirt.” His words held no heat. 
“So you do think you can win?” 
Tomrin grunted. “Will you beat him at the knife toss?” 
“After tossing a purposeful sucker or two?” Robles said. “Easy.”
“Tell me what’s going on.” 
“The backup plan if you lose?” Robles asked. 
“So confident in me?”
“When robbing a censor, always have an escape route, I say.” 
“We aren’t robbing Rennly,” Tomrin said, though it did feel like Rennly was stealing something from him. What exactly Tomrin couldn’t say. Fighting for money was undignified, and gambling went against his belief in his ability to use his mind—not crude muscle and luck. Feathered Rennly, he thought but muttered. “Feathered Woolad. Even the sun burns hotter here.”
“You shouldn’t say that overly loud,” Robles cautioned. 
“I know,” Tomrin said. The evil was speaking for him and it frightened him. It was like the parts of him were flying loose. “This thing between Rennly and I—I thought it was all over.” 
“Well, here he comes,” Robles said, not helping.
Rennly came from the direction of the knife toss. “I’m going to whip you both,” he said. “Certainly hope you two are better at glass than you are at the martial arts. Or my golden ducks are going to fly away, never to return.”
Tomrin pretended to watch the bout for a minute. The artless clack of staff on staff was a discordant tune in his ears. The need to strike at Rennly, to cut him down; to chop him down finally grew too strong to ignore. Tomrin turned to face him. “You think you know us,” he said. “But you are wrong.”
“Oh, really?”
“Let’s change the wager. Beat us both and you will have a voice.”
“I already have a voice,” Rennly said. 
“Not inside the shop you don’t. We are the creators. We are the artists. We are the craftsmen. We are the masters—we—Robles and I.”
Rennly grunted.
“Um, I’m not really that good,” Robles said. “And, I think maybe the heat’s getting to Tomrin.” 
Rennly didn’t blink but glared at Tomrin. Tomrin, however, was not finished. Though he didn’t know what Robles planned for the knife toss, he was convinced his friend would prevail. Armed with that confidence, he slid his final barb home. “If you beat us both, you get a voice inside the shop, but if one of us beats you, I decide what night of the week we meet.”
Dable stepped from the path. “You boys still making bets?” He and Marten walked together like two men who had come to some understanding, friendly and diffidently on both their parts. For a moment Tomrin envied his father’s ability to make friends so easily. The big Orish man didn’t loom over Dable. Both were grand in their own individual ways; Marten in his careful way; Dable in his gleaming white cashmere robe, perfectly clean.
A group of three Rubish men trailed behind them. One was Nuttel. They were three of the richest gentlemen of the Woolad area. One of the other two was Penn Rejal.
“Amendments cost extra,” Marten said.
“Just working out some final question of leadership is all,” Robles said, sounding annoyed. He flashed a sidelong look at Tomrin. 
Tomrin shrugged it off. Rennly needed to learn his place. “That is if Censor Richot wants to show us how it’s done,” Tomrin added.
“Fine,” Rennly said, clearly annoyed. “I like this. I agree. Knives are first after all.” 
“Now knives?” one of the men asked. He was old, and his hair white. He dressed worse than the other two, a real codger, his shirt and pants patched, making him seem all the more miserly. “Uncivilized,” the man added. Tomrin agreed silently to himself, wondering if he’d misjudged the man.
Back at the knife toss pavilion, a crowd formed. The words gold and ducks sailed through in the air. Nuttel spoke loudly and Tomrin did not have to wonder how everyone knew about their wagering. The knife toss’ grandmaster asked if the staff bout was over. Robles and Rennly had delayed their final showdown until after the staves’ champion had been chosen. 
“Change of plans,” Rennly explained as he walked up to the first line. “Knives first. After I beat Master Robles here, then I’ll be ready to beat Master Tomrin.”
Robles hissed in Tomrin’s ear. “We wanted to wait in case you won.” 
“And if I lose?” Tomrin asked in a whisper.
“You’ll do fine,” Robles replied. “And, it’s too late now.” He waved to three young boys calling his name and walked over to them. Robles shook their hands as if he was running for mayor. He didn’t seem the least bit worried about planting his dog-headed knife in his bale’s bullseye.
Rennly tossed his knife first. It stabbed his own roll of hay. Bullseye. The crowd cheered and Tomrin rubbed the wound on his chest. Maybe it was just the heat, but his head was full of pressure and there was nothing he could do for it but scratch his itch. Even that helped very little. 
Robles stepped into position and, pulling out his knife, he tossed it in one smooth motion, flicking it almost absently. Thuth. Bullseye. The crowd cheered for him.
He and Rennly each retrieved their knives as the game master gawked with everyone else. “After you,” Rennly said, a touch of unease in his voice. Perhaps it was dawning on him that Robles was a challenge after all.
“Certainly,” Robles replied. He threw his knife, making little show of it, lining up for a whole second before sending his knife into the bullseye once more.
Rennly made two practice motions before his own knife flew the fifteen paces and found a bullseye of its own. For him, as with Robles’ throw, there was a round of polite claps as the record keeper announced the bullseyes to a more subdued crowd anxious to see who would win.
With knives in hand, Robles and Rennly moved to the far rope strung across the dirt at twenty paces. 
This time Rennly went first. He sized up the target and—for reasons beyond Tomrin’s understanding—his own knife. Tomrin wanted to crack a wise one, but ice filled his chest cavity and he held his tongue with everyone else. The idea of calling attention to himself scared him.
Rennly lobbed the knife. It spun with a languid arc before stabbing his bale’s outer blue bullseye. Thurk. People clapped and cheered once again.
“A good throw,” Robles said magnanimously. He tucked his knife away in its sheath at his hip.
Rennly frowned. “Conceding?”
Tomrin’s own heart skipped and thudded in his chest. What are you doing, Robles?
“No, I’m just going to throw the way I’ve practiced.” Robles replied. He turned to the crowd and Tomrin. “Knives may not be civilized, but they are still a lot of fun.” He looked right at Tomrin as he walked over. He winked and, wearing a large grin on his lupine face, he said: “Say when.”
“What?” Tomrin asked. He blinked. “When?”
Robles stood ten paces from the throw line, all the way to the ropes which held everyone back. His hand went to his hip faster than an adders’ strike. He spun and the knife exited the sheath at his hip. The knife didn’t even seem to enter his hand. It was like Robles slapped it and it flew free of its leather case, button popping. Clith. The knife didn’t arc as it flew, but struck the bale like iced lightning. Cathud. It buried itself past the hilt: dead bullseye. Then just as suddenly, another knife tricked into Robles’ other hand. It glinted and shot through the air then struck Rennly’s bale next to Rennly’s knife. Thud. Another dead-on bullseye. 
“Bam, bam, both!” Robles said as he turned and bowed, his arms held wide open to the cheering and clapping crowd. 
The old codger, however, didn’t seem impressed. “Still don’t see how any of this has a feathered thing to do with founding glass,” he said. 
Tomrin found himself agreeing with the man as Rennly’s eyes bugged and twitched with rage.🔖

Chapter 19: The Price of Failure
Even the gods place their trust in gold.
	—An old Rubish saying

Robles proudly displayed his first-place ribbon, pinning it on his chest with a bodkin from his pack. “I am the hero of the hour!” he said, smiling as he soaked in the adulation.
“Never has any one competition, in my memory, ever elicited such interest,” Tomrin said. “But you are a bit of a showman. I bet you have a puzzle in your pack right now you are dying to show us.” Often or not, Robles’ puzzles were just some simple blacksmith’s puzzle; a small sword trapped in a toy anvil; or rings—the point of which was to extract one from the others. Robles would often make some off-hand remark about their ultimate meaning, announcing a prize like becoming king, even if Corundum hadn’t a king in years—not since the Emperor’s Restoration. “So enjoy it. Your hour is nearly up.”
	“True, true,” Robles lamented.
Rennly, unamused, stalked past them. “I’ve fallen in with a pair of vipers,” he said, stuffing his second-place ribbon in his pocket. The crowd followed as he, Robles, and Tomrin headed for the staves pavilion. 
At the Gorkel’s tent, the referee chided Tomrin and Rennly. “I was going to forfeit the both of you,” he said. “And give first place to Mezda.” 
“And have a riot in your hand?” Robles asked loudly to a round of laughter. 
The referee frowned and tossed up his hands. “Well, you are finally here,” he said, and stomped over to the scorekeeper, his brother. There was a smattering of cheers, but poor Mezda seemed crestfallen. Tomrin couldn’t blame the man. He also wished their round had been canceled—if for other reasons.
Rennly muttered something as he picked out his staff.
“What was that?” Tomrin asked.
“I said Henk and Ressel are probably lost in a shell of tarsk right now, and I have no one to tie my streamer.” 
Tomrin glanced at the crowd. Robles and Dable and Marten and the patriarchs stood chatting as they waited for the bout to start. “Have Robles do it.” Tomrin said. 
“So kind of you to offer not your own help, but someone else’s,” Rennly said and stomped off.
Tomrin picked up his staff, annoyed. He tried to make sense of Rennly, but couldn’t. Retrieving his yellow cloth streamer from Mistress Gorkle, he brought it over to his father Dable who stood next to Rennly and Robles. “Thanks, Papa,” he said after Rennly stomped back into the ring. 
“Be on your toes,” Dable said. “Rennly has his hackles up.” 
Tomrin looked at Robles. His Orioles friend raised his eyebrows. “Yes?”
“What bet were you going to make with Rennly?” 
“Don’t worry about that,” Robles said. “Just get in there and rearrange his face for me.”
“I’ll be lucky if he doesn’t rearrange mine,” Tomrin said and turned back to the ring. He stepped into the rope circle.
The referee explained the critical rules. Points for strikes only. No grappling. No head shots. If anyone fell, no strikes until they were back up. Tomrin had heard it all before, plenty of times. Play was to fifty or until the first person had a ten-strike lead. 
On the referee’s signal Tomrin bowed to Rennly. Rennly bent slightly. His eyes gleamed a pale green in the deceptively low sun. The first day, the only fun day of the festival, neared its end. 
Bending upright, Tomrin shifted to his left, circling and watching Rennly’s staff like a hawk as Rennly circled, his staff probing. For a moment they traded blows, each catching the other’s staff with their own, deflecting possible strikes. Clat, clat! Clat, clat! Tomrin swung his staff at Rennly, shoulder high. He added power while maintaining a semblance of defense. 
Rennly ducked as his staff flowed up and at an angle. Tomrin’s staff went high, Rennly swung low. Tomrin dodged, jumping backwards. “Ha!” Rennly said. 
Tomrin grimaced, but reassured himself. It’s fine. Moving backwards was a show of ineptitude. He and Rennly circled, tapping staves, each continuing to probe for weakness. Nat, nat. Nat, nat. Rennly smiled. He wanted this. He was playing before getting on with it. 
Tomrin struck out with a wild blow. Rennly blocked it with the middle of his staff. Clatch. Rennly’s own counterattack came swiftly. Clack! With each of his heavy blows—two Blacksmith Hammers, and a third set of back and forth Holy Threshers—Rennly’ grin faded. The power in his swings sent vibrations into Tomrin’s hands and pain erupted in his knuckles. Clack, clack! Flutch, fletch. Flackk!  Slowly, his finger numbed to the pain and his hands merged with the wood of the staff. “Is that all you brought?” Tomrin asked through clenched teeth. 
Rennly sneered. “What about you? Are you even trying?”
Rennly continued to probe as they circled. The crowd watched in silence. One face alone stood out, Counselor Marten’s, the look of concern gone from his eyes. Once a soldier, he watched now with a soldier’s eye, his face blank of all emotion. He nodded a slight salute. Given what Margretta had said about the man, he had probably come as protection and was now powerless in his task.
Rennly’s staff clacked against Tomrin’s. Tomrin lashed out with an open blow, swinging wildly with his staff. Rennly countered. Clack. His staff stabbed Tomrin in the thigh. “Point blue!” The pain shocked Tomrin. He was certain he’d be bruised to the bone.
“Give it back to him,” a voice cried out. Bethany Karlite was in the crowd. Her presence added a strange nervousness to Tomrin’s feet. They needed his conscious control as he stumbled around the dusty ring. 
Rennly swung his staff. Tomrin blocked. Clack. Tomrin stepped. Again Rennly swung. Clack. Tomrin edged his staff against Rennly’s shoulder. His own power sapped his finesse. “Point Yellow,” called the referee. Tomrin blocked Rennly’s counter attack. Clack.
Their feet filled the air with bright orange dust as the sun filtered sideways through the pavilion. Tomrin began to vie for the light against Rennly. Each fought to keep the sun at their backs.
Rennly continued to rain blows down, but each strike he gained, Tomrin repaid—if much softer. Rennly’s staff hit Tomrin’s streamer. He struck Rennly’s ankle. Rennly smacked Tomrin on the chest. Tomrin repaid him with a jab to the leg. 
Finally, Tomrin let himself pant. He was wearing down and he feared he was going to lose after all. Feathers, he swore. His heavy breathing dried his throat and he was sore everywhere. His heart pounded and the mass of evil inside pounded with it, aching to come out. 
Rennly swung like he was closing a heavy door with both hands. Tomrin stepped in to block him, taking advantage of the awkward two-handed motion. But Rennly’s swing was a trick, worthy of Robles. Their staves connected and Rennly’s staff jammed down on Tomrin’s foot. It crushed his foot through the boot. Cruk. 
“Feather!” Tomrin swore. 
“Hurt?”
“You broke something.” 
“As long as it wasn’t your hands,” Rennly said. “You’ll need those to pay me back.” 
“I’ll pay you back,” Tomrin said, but hobbled to keep up their martial dance. 
“He’s hurt! Call the match!” the Orish counselor called out. Hushed noises came from the crowd. Tomrin could see no one through the glare as he hopped about like a one-legged crow.
“No!” he shouted. “I’m fine!” He was mad as a hornet, but strangely calm, and when he looked at Rennly he saw what he was. “You are nothing but a boy, Rennly, a bully, because your father beat you.”
“My father never laid a finger on me.”
“You’re a liar and a fraud.”
“And you’re nothing but a half-breed Peregrine slave overreaching his station,” Rennly said.
“Not overreaching,” Tomrin replied. “I have created my own fortunes. I’m not trying to buy or inherit one. I don’t think there is anything special about being born Rubish. Same as there is nothing special about being born Orioles.” 
Rennly struck another blow for blue and laughed.  “Ha. Can’t you tell I’m toying with you? Giving you what you deserve for that kind of blasphemy.” 
The mass inside Tomrin’s chest throbbed, calling to him. He could feel its terrible power. Corrupt though it was—or because of the corruption—the Luster called to him now more than it had ever. It shouted, promising power greater than the Leviathan’s own terrible might. 
You could do anything! Rennly was a bug compared to the power the Luster promised. Defy the gods! Set yourself up as king! No, emperor! And not just of Corundum, but Gearthrum itself! And Serathus besides! He would be special—not cursed. Nothing would be denied him. Nothing and no one could stand in his way. He could be a tyrant to end all tyrants!
Tomrin shook his head and focused on the pain in his foot. The Luster was a lie. He knew it and smiled to himself. He would not let it or Rennly push him around. “You don’t think I can’t tell what you are playing at?”
“Do you?” Rennly demanded as he swung his staff high. “Then why are you smiling?”
Tomrin ducked. A head strike was illegal, yet if he had let it go through it would be a point for him, not Rennly, but one point was little compared to a staff in the face. Tomrin didn’t need points. Win or lose, he had already won the important concession in the knife throw—and he had just beaten the seductive Luster. Now all he had to do was deny Rennly what he wanted most—to hurt him. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” Tomrin said. “But you are not my judge nor my executioner. You are just a couple of golden ducats to me, nothing more. Dress yourself up in black and you are still nothing.” 
“You don’t know anything,” Rennly hissed as Tomrin blocked a blow with the rattling end of his staff. 
“I know Dable is your real father,” Tomrin said as Rennly slashed wildly with his staff and Tomrin’s staff struck him in the leg. Point yellow. “You want his fortunes, but as long as I and Hadras stand in your way, you get nothing.” Rennly said nothing. He slammed his staff against Tomrin’s as if trying to drive him to the ground. His eyes filled with cold hatred, but Tomrin held him off. “You will never be his great son,” Tomrin continued. “Can’t you see it? He loves Hadras more than you or me?”
Someone in the crowd wondered aloud what the two of them were waiting for. Tomrin redirected Rennly’s staff and delivered a strike, clipping Rennly’s elbow. Point yellow. Pained surprise filled Rennly’s eyes with angry heat. But the heat cooled quickly and turned mean. Tomrin began fending blow after blow, many aimed at his bad leg. He was just thankful it wasn’t his chest. He feared the burn might split open and begin to bleed. 
In Rennly’s single-mindedness, Tomrin kept the score close. Soon, however, he began to tire. Fatigue also slacked Rennly’s face. He was conserving energy for his attacks. He circled slower and slower, to the point Tomrin feared a trick. 
I can still win this, he thought as he wondered if Rennly was milking the full fifty strikes. Their staves clacked together in their interminable dance. The crowd cheered each strike, counting up the points for yellow and blue without waiting for the scorekeeper to announce their points.
With a quick blow to Tomrin’s forearm, Rennly broke forty first. Tomrin returned the strike. One welt was just one more. “Yellow point,” the referee called. The crowd called out thirty-nine. 
Rennly lashed out with his staff, leaving himself exposed across the chest. His staff struck Tomrin’s shoulder. Fack. Forty-one for blue. Tomrin returned the favor. Fack. Forty for yellow. 
Then Rennly’s staff slapped Tomrin’s chest. The strike emptied his mind from the pain of the blow even though it had missed his wound by an inch. “Ahh!” he cried. Rennly smiled cruelly but Tomrin could barely see him as his eyes blurred up. His step-brother struck another two quick blows: arm, shoulder, but compared to the chest wound, they hurt not a bit.
Tomrin dropped into a defensive stance and he held the staff more in the center. He wiped his eyes between the blows Rennly sent at him. Clack, clack. His Blacksmith’s Hammer came down over and over. Clack, clack! Clach! Clach! Clach!
Suddenly Rennly’s staff shattered. Clash! That wasn’t supposed to happen, but before Tomrin could score a strike the referee yelled. “Halt!” 
Kicking at the free half, Rennly tossed what was left of his staff out of the ring. He walked to the barrel and selected a new weapon. Tomrin wiped his eyes, breathing heavily as if he had run a mile. 
Brandishing his fresh staff like a flail, Rennly strode back into the ring. Tomrin changed back into the standard foot forward pose like a man serious about staves. When Rennly attacked, it felt to Tomrin his own training came back to him. Maybe with his fists, Rennly had strength to make up for his lack of skill. But staves were not fists. 
Tomrin turned Rennly’s attacks against him and held his staff like an extension of himself. He struck Rennly, and yet despite his skill, Rennly struck him too, but the hits no longer hurt. They were desperate strikes from a desperate and grasping man whose jealous eyes betrayed his own fear of losing. 
They circled the ring. Rennly pushed Tomrin back around the rope with his remaining strength, but what appeared like weakness was strategy. Tomrin feigned one way then abruptly changed directions; each time he made a strike at Rennly’s legs, Rennly would counter, but he missed his strike and their staves clattered together. Before long they tied, forty-nine to forty-nine. 
Over the shouting crowd Robles howled at him. “Finish him, Tomrin!” Robles shouted. “Chew his legs off!” 
Dusk settled as they circled. In the descending twilight, irritation settled in Rennly’s green eyes. “You’re messing with me?” he said as he worked his staff more cautiously. 
Only habit kept Tomrin’s own staff from falling out of his hands. Just one move point and he’d be champion. “I am not a bully, Rennly,” he said. “If anyone is dragging this out, it’s you.”
Rennly charged and swung with the power equal to any Orish farmhand. It was a wonder the new staff didn’t break like the old one. He slammed it into Tomrin’s staff, clack. He drove Tomrin’s back back against his body. The haft of Rennly’s staff just touched him below the jaw on the side of his neck. 
“Point blue!” the referee roared. “Blue the winner!”
Tomrin’s counter hit Rennly in the leg. But the match was over. The crowd cried, “Fifty! Fifty!” drowning out the score keeper. For a second Tomrin stood confused, thinking he had won. The tap on his neck hadn’t even hurt. He’d blocked it down too little more than a kiss. I lost? The crowd flooded into the ring to congratulate them both. 
Suddenly Robles was yelling in his ear. “Now, that was a fight!” 
The Gorkles however were yelling at everyone. “We’re not done! Stay back! There is still another bout. We need to decide second place! We still have to decide second place!” 
Tomrin had no interest in fighting again, not for second place, not even if it were for first at this point. His foot hurt to put weight on it. Every muscle in his body smarted. He had no reason to care about second place, yet Tomrin was grateful when the crowd finally pulled back so he could breathe. When they did, his staff was the only thing keeping him from falling over. 
“I’m not fighting for second place,” he told the referee.
“What? You want to forfeit?” the man sounded incredulous, as if it was unheard of. He clearly didn’t understand the pain. 
“Well, “Tomrin replied. “All I want is a tall tin of tarsk.” 
Rennly smirked at him, but Tomrin didn’t care. Rennly was just a lunk of muscle; he was not even that good at staves.
The referee frowned and raised his eyebrows in surprise at Tomrin’s acceptance. “I guess you are happy with third?” 
“No, he doesn’t place if he forfeits,” the Gorkel matriarch said. “The rules are quite clear.” 
Dable, who had left the ring with the others, spoke from the side-lines. “What are you saying, Carnila?” He was frowning and his green eyes glinted darkly in the twilight. He walked over to her as she tumbled through her rule book. Not all games had rules laid out in books, yet those like the staves competition were institutions going back to the beginning, its rules passed on long before being written down. 
Carnila put her finger down on a page and read. “An adult player who forfeits may not place in his competition.” 
“May not. May,” Dable said, as he braved Carnila at her own table. “He may not—but he also may as well.” 
“But may not,” Carnila replied stoutly.
Tomrin hobbled over on his staff and good foot. He was afraid his father was going to make an unseemly fuss. 
The referee followed at Tomrin’s side. “Let me take a look, Mother,” the man said.
“May means he still could,” Dable insisted. 
“Dable Watersipper,” Carnila said. “I think I know how to read the rule book, it’s been in my family for twenty generations, since before the Leviathan cracked the World Egg.” 
Tomrin doubted that, but instead of arguing with her, he tried to console his father. “It’s just a game. I only entered the competition to satisfy the contract.” 
His father turned on him. “And what about the prize money?” 
“A few silvers, who cares?” 
“You should take on the other challenger, you’ll beat Forny again easily.” 
Tomrin shook his head and walked over to the barrel and dropped the stick. Tunt. He turned and hobbled towards Robles. 
“That’s a forfeit!” Carnila called to the crowd and they started talking more loudly.
“Good work,” Robles said.
“Was it?”
“You survived.” 
“And I guess that’s all I needed to do,” Tomrin replied. “Tarsk?”
“After the ribbons are passed out.”
Rennly walked towards them as he escorted Dable away from Carnila’s table. “Good bout,” Rennly said, grinning. “I look forward to our next one.” 
Dable shook his head at Tomrin. “I don’t understand why you didn’t just finish.” 
“Because I’m hurt, and don’t need to be hurt any further.”
“But the glory,” Dable persisted. 
“Glory?” Tomrin scoffed. “I don’t care about glory.”
The referee raised his voice to ask for silence. “I’m going to announce the winners,” he said, holding up three pouches of leather and ribbons tied to each of the coin purses. As he called out second and third, two winners gathered their prizes in turn. Rennly gathered the large purse and the blue ribbon tied to it. He smiled a gloating smile as he walked back to them, as if his win mattered. “Now,” the referee continued. “For best-in-show!” Tomrin hoped that it went to a young Rubish boy named Mathis; having seen him fight, he had skill and had made a good show. The crowd grew quiet. “For best-in-show.” The referee repeated. “I think we all know who it goes to,” he said. “Best-in-show goes to our very own Watersipper! Tomrin Watersipper!” 
The crowd took a second to digest what it had heard before erupting in cheers.🔖


Chapter 20: Tarsk Town
His path is laid clear,
For even in darkness,
The mist lights the way.
—From The Dark Verses

Oil torches lit the interior of Tarsk Town, the tent complex run by the proprietors of a local tavern, The Uglier Twin. Tomrin and Robles entered through the Shanty Town entrance. Crude humor flew out of the mouths here as fast as the Orish serving girl helped the patrons tossed tarsk into them. Two Orish men, the two loudest, shouted at each other. They compared each other’s looks to the posterior of different farm animals, each quip generating a gale of laughter from their mates.
Tomrin glanced at Robles. “Should have gone in through the castle entrance,” he muttered. “My foot is throbbing. A ten penny tax would have been worth it.”
Robles grinned wryly. He pushed through the rough benches to the Merchants’ Quarter entrance where the Ugly Twin served high-spirit tarsk as well as low. The benches were padded here and a sign in chalk on a wall explained each drink’s price. The serving women here were Peregrine, not Orish. Instead of being dressed in rough bodices and skirts, they wore a demure style which had gone out of fashion with the Emperor’s Restoration and slave tax. 
 Tomrin found it hard to get into the spirit of the theme. Down only to drink, sloppy people lounged about, slurring their speech. At five coppers a tin for high-spirit tarsk, the Merchants Quarters was a worse den of thieves than the Shanty Town. 
“Out-of-towners,” Robles said, but Tomrin was pretty sure he recognised several of the drunken “merchants.” He knew the pretty Peregrine woman waiting on the tables, though he couldn’t place her name. 
She knew Robles, however, and she smiled from ruddy check to ruddy check as she intercepted them. “Master Robles, fancy seeing you back in Woolad, yet again.” 
“I never miss the festival if I can help it, Timea.” He gave her a peck on the cheek. “It’s like a bad habit I can’t kick.”
“Will you be joining us?” 
“I am sorry but we must forge on. I’m afraid we have a hankering for real tarsk.”
 Tomrin’s foot throbbed. If she offered him a seat now, he would have taken it, but the crestfallen Timea shooed them on their way. “I’ll be back this way...soon,” Robles told her, but she already turned to a nearby table. A Rubish man with the manners of an Orish farm hand needed more high-spirit tarsk and was demanding it loudly. 
At the entrance of the King’s Quarters, an Orish man dressed in red, green, and blue, barred their way. “The bribe is a penny,” the man said, putting a hand on the wooden sword at his hip. “Gentleman,” he added belatedly.
“Is that a penny each, Randy?” Robles asked as he worked his coin purse open. He extracted two small coins from his leather pouch, and then a third. 
“Well, you two gentlemen look quite prosperous,” Randy said. 
Robles handed the man the three coins. “One for the Emperor and his beautiful daughter, the princess, and one for their most trusted guardsman,” Robles said and Randy’s fingers around the coins. “That’s you, Randy.” 
“Right,” Randy said, blinking. “Right… Right this way,” He bowed awkwardly around his wooden sword. 
Robles bowed in return. Tomrin grunted out a “thank you” as he hobbled into the King’s Quarters of the tent complex. Here the tables were actual tables. Men and women sat in actual chairs. The smell of sweat was not as strong as the smell of real tarsk in the air. “We should have come in the back way,” Tomrin said.
“And miss saying hello to Timea?” Robles asked, sounding as if the idea were completely out of the question and that Tomrin was daft to suggest it. 
A heavy set Rubish serving woman called Clara—“Lady Clara,” she said—sat them at one of the empty tables. The prices were marked on a linen worked like a tapestry. It proclaimed real tarsk was ten silver pennies for a single shell. As Tomrin glanced around he noticed all the tins were made of glass, each a bit crude, but glass all the same.
“Glass tins are a nice touch,” Tomrin admitted to Robles when Clara left them to figure out what they wanted. 
“Real tarsk for both of us,” Robles told her when she returned. “And Lady Clara, my fine feathered friend here is a bit of a glass aficionado so can you see that we receive your finest shells?”
 “Of course. Our finest shells.”
“This isn’t bad,” Robles said when she left.
“I need to check my foot,” Tomrin replied. Sore and stiff all over, his foot worried him more than the ambiance. He peeled off his boot carefully. In the flickering lamp light he could see the top of his foot was a swollen blue. 
“Lovely,” Robles said of Tomrin’s foot on his chair’s arm. “Looks like it hurts.” 
Their tarsk arrived. Tomrin removed his foot from the armrest of Robles’ chair. Tomrin quaffed a large quantity of the milky fluid while Robles paid Clara. He waited for his tongue, lips, mouth, and throat to numb. The tarsk was nice and strong. “Potent,” he said, letting himself relax.
Robles took a sip and concurred. “Not as strong as your father’s, but it will do.” 
The ground was swept with last year’s chaff, soft underfoot. Canteen lamps burned dirty red flames into the air. The loud sounds in the other tents, semi-muted by the walls which separated them, continued. 
Tomrin drank a second sip of his tarsk as Robles slapped him absently, and stood with his glass shell. “That’s Booker.” He nodded his head to the far table. “We should say, hello.” 
Tomrin pointed through the table. “I’m going to rest my foot,” he said. Robles shook his head and walked over to Booker’s table.
Tomrin sipped his tarsk. The first wave hit him. The rumbling of the revelers grew distant. The murmur of voices was almost pleasant. Taking off his other boot, he prepared to stand. Behind him a voice, a woman’s voice, rolled smoothly over the back of his neck. For a split second it froze him stiff. Bethany Karlite was paying off the man in the back entrance, bypassing the Merchant’s Quarter and the Shanty Town tents. She was on her way inside, but instead of money she paid the man with a kiss. “There is more where that came from,” she said. “After your watch, you know where to find me.”
Tomrin’s vision dimmed as his mind cleared. The people of the tent glowed and grew out of the chaff strewn on the ground. He perversely hoped Bethany stopped to say hello, yet feared she might. Better she ignored him and walked on by. 
Her bribe paid, the man guarding the tent thanked her and she brushed inside. The murmur of her dress against the canvas sent the hair on Tomrin’s arms on end. He stared at his hands as if they were the most interesting things in the tent. 
“Tomrin Watersipper,” Bethany said, bending over him as she placed a hand on his shoulder. Her floral scent filled his nose. “Drinking tarsk, I see,” she said as she bent up. “And all by yourself.”
“Yes, tarsk,” he murmured. “But, no. Robles is here.” 
Bethany moved around and blocked his view of the tent’s not-quite-regal denizens. In her dress, she looked as lovely as any queen. Her dark Peregrine hair glowed in the lamplight like a crown. Pulling out Robles’ chair for herself, she sat down opposite Tomrin.
Lady Clara swooped in. “What’s your pleasure, Love?” The buxom serving lady said. Bethany turned a smokey gaze on Clara. The two exchanged something in their glances. Lady Clara amended her question. “What would you like, my lady?”
“Low-spirit tarsk,” Bethany replied. “But I’d like one of these fancy tins made of glass, if you don’t mind.” 
“Only best for royalty,” Lady Clara declared stoutly and scurried off.
“Rennly is still giving you bruises,” Bethany said as her eyes lighted on the purpling of Tomrin’s arms.
He didn’t move, but sat perfectly still, his hands glued to the glass and table. Against the leaden weight of his arms, the world pushed up into them. He hated Bethany knowing Rennly beat him. “This is nothing,” Tomrin said. “You see Rennly?” 
“Really? You knocked the wool out of him finally?” she said. “I didn’t see that.”
“No,” Tomrin said wryly. “Not a scratch.”
Bethany laughed. “I’m sure next time you will beat him soundly.”
Tomrin rubbed the bruise on his left arm. “Next time.” 
“So what are you two fighting over? I heard talk of money?” Bethany asked. “If I needed money I’d fly off to Corundum.” 
“I’ve been to Corundum,” Tomrin said, not answering her question. 
“Really?” She seemed surprised.
“Briefly, and I don’t want to go back.” 
“Why not?” 
“Too many people.” 
Clara returned with a clear glass filled with Bethany’s yellow drink. When Clara left, Tomrin asked Bethany what she and Rennly talked about at the funeral.
“We didn’t say a word to each other.”
“But you don’t like him,” Tomrin said. It wasn’t a question.
Bethany stood up. “I won’t speak ill of a censor, Tomrin Watersipper,” she said.  “I owe Censor Rickot…for everything I am.” She marched, drink in hand, towards the Merchant Quarter’s tent and disappeared.
Lady Clara stepped over. “That Mistress Karlite is no good,” she said. Before she could say more, a man began shouting at the entrance guard.
“Ten pennies just to enter! Each? One should be good for all. Not ten each!” Rejal’s loud complaining voice broke the spell over Tomrin’s hands. Pulling them from the table, he ran his fingers through his hair.
“Just pay him, Rejal.” The voice was that of the older gentleman Rejal had been with earlier in the day. “We don’t have forever.”
After paying their bribes, Dable, Marten, and Rennly, and the three men entered. Tomrin set his hands back down and the heaviness pushed his shoulders down. The weight was was just the tarsk, but Tomrin couldn’t help but think that the strange feeling was how Emperor Jarvis felt, trapped on his gem encrusted throne. 
“That’s my boy,” Dable said loudly. “Best-in-show! I told you that we’d find him here if he was here!” He clapped Tomrin on the back. Lady Clara stepped away during the commotion as they sat, dragging over chairs to his table.
Grabbing a chair from an errant table, Robles loped over. “Gentlemen,” he said, setting the chair down with a bow. “Welcome to the castle.” He sounded like he owned the place and that he was its true heir. Tomrin found himself breathing easier, the weight was still there, but it was a more pleasant sensation. Tarsk. He wanted another and when Clara came over for the others, he had his shell refilled. 
“Now down to business,” Dable said when everyone had drunk from their shells or in Rejal’s case, his tin. The man ordered a low-spirit tarsk. It made Tomrin want to shake his head.
“Yes,” Robles said, steering the conversation deftly to what mattered. “There is money to be made in glass. Golden ducks aplenty.”
Tomrin stared at the gathered men. The three miserly men were interested in two things: Robles and the talk of gold. Rennly’s face was a mask of pleasant charm, while Dable appeared so satisfied with everything he looked like he might split. Marten, however, glanced from man to man. When the large Orish counselor caught Tomrin staring at him, he blinked and nodded thoughtfully. Tomrin nodded back.
“I really think we should have my daughter-in-law’s brother here,” Rejal said. “He knows glass.”
“Master Holerum?” Robles asked. “He runs a shop here in town?” 
Rejal nodded. “He does.” 
“I thought so,” Robles said. “And he probably knows something, but I can assure you—” 
“Asking him makes a goat’s feathers more sense than knives and slaves,” Rejal said. The man had a point.
“No offense to your daughter-in-law’s brother, Lord Rejal,” Robles said, holding up his glass tin. “When it comes to making glasses such as these, it is child’s play compared to what we are doing at Godly Glassworks. Our lowest skilled worker could do this well. I can do better than any Master Holerum can put out—and that’s not bragging.”
“Sure sounds like it to me,” Rejal replied. No one spoke as he sipped his low-spirit tarsk and set it down. “So, you’re good?” 
“Me? No,” Robles said, setting down his own glass undrank. “I’m decent but I’m hardly a master. Even before Master Laz passed away, he was surpassed by a glass worker with twice his skill, maybe more, a true genius for glass.” He pointed at Tomrin. 
“Well—I—ah—” Tomrin stuttered. 
“Well, are you good or not?” Rejal demanded.
“I’m pretty good,” Tomrin said. 
“He invented a new lens the other day,” Robles added. 
Dable laughed. “He’s pretty good. Just up and invented a lens the other day, like it’s nothing!” He took a swig of tarsk, emptying his glass in a single go and slamming it down. “That’s how you know he’s my boy!”
Tomrin began formulating a plan to leave. He had the perfect excuse. His foot from the drubbing Rennly gave him was hurting. 
“I might be mistaken,” Robles said, “But if I had to guess, I would say you fine gentlemen are looking to invest in Godly Glassworks.” He eyed the men in turn. “Please correct me if I’m wrong?” 
“This all sounds good to me, but I need to go salve my foot,” Tomrin said, kicking back his chair to put on his boots. 
“I thought you two were serious,” the oldest gentlemen said.
Tomrin flushed with irritation. He had months’ worth of pay in his pocket. He didn’t need this man’s money. He didn’t need a salary. “I am serious about glass. If you—” Tomrin stomped on a boot. “—want to put money in, that’s up to Robles. I master the glass; he masters everything else.” In the ensuing silence at the table, Tomrin, sucked air as his foot cried out in pain as he pulled on the other boot. 
“Is that even legal?” Rejal asked. 
“I don’t see why not,” Marten offered. “We all heard him. Words spoken are just as good as written when witnessed by so many.” 
Tomrin stood up. “There you go, then.” He picked up his tarsk, drained it and set the glass back down. Affecting a poor bow, he offered them all a goodnight before heading for the entrance to the merchant tent, the same way Bethany had left.
Robles caught him at the entrance. “They are going to want some control.” 
“I trust you,” Tomrin said. “Whatever you think is right. You know I’ll be happy with it. You’re the Pack Leader. As long as I’m still the Kingbird of the Glass, I’m good with anything.” 
“I can’t believe you are leaving me with these mad cats,” Robles said. 
“My foot, man.” 
“It’s not that bad.” 
“It’s not your foot,” Tomrin said. “Next time, will I only be hobbling?” 
“Rennly’s not important. He’s a clown in a black dress.” 
“But he’s a clown trying to kill me.”
“That’s fair, but—”
Marten walked over. “I need a quick word with, Master Watersipper.” The Orish man said to Robles. 
“All yours, Counselor,” Robles replied, visibly irritated. “I am just going to do what I think is best. If I don’t see you tomorrow, I’ll see you in Menad.” He turned and headed back to the overpopulated table. 
“What is it, Counselor Marten? Everything fine?” Tomrin said. It wasn’t a read question. The man was worried for him, shadowing him like this. It needed to stop.
“Lady Margretta wanted me to remind you—to tell you—she forgot to tell you: whatever you do, don’t drink from the Wellspring. She needs to train you first.” 
“I know that,” Tomrin said, just as quietly as the man, his voice a whisper. “I’m not a fool. You—.” 
“She’s worried… With the stress you’re under you might do something. You know?” Marten sounded embarrassed. “Sometimes the stress makes it easier to reach the Dark Halcyon, to feel the pull. Sometimes the Pond will sing to people. Just ignore it. It is a mirage.” 
“I don’t know anything about that, but if I needed to know, I’m sure that would be the first thing I would know,” Tomrin said. “Why don’t you let her know that? I’m not an unread peasant,” he added. “And, Councilor, you need not follow me.” 
“Of course not. Good. Good,” Marten said. “I’ll let you go. If anyone asks, I was just letting you know your legal obligation still holds with Master Robles negotiating on your behalf.” 
“Fine, yes,” Tomrin said. “One more thing, Counselor?”
“Yes?”
“Tell me. Did Lady Margretta tank our deal with the Sapphire Front?”
“If she did, this is the first I am hearing of it.”
Tomrin sighed. “Thank you.”
“And one last thing, myself,” Marten said.
“My half-brother, Rennly?”
Marten nodded. “He is your enemy, Tomrin. He wants you dead.”
“Thank you, but I already know that as well.”
Marten nodded and with the grace unusual to men his size, he turned and left Tomrin standing blocking the way as a couple stumbled in from the Merchant Quarter. Tomrin stepped awkwardly around them as the man remarked on the quality of gentlemen these days. “They can’t even hold the door for a lady.”🔖


Chapter 21: A Small Bug
I believe us to be inside someone else’s dark, empty nothing.
—From the Head Astronomer, Edon Main’s, personal notes, circa 326 AC

Tomrin registered little wonder at flying. Woolad shrunk from view. The world grew blue and green. The sun shined red, a ruby hanging with the other stars. Tomrin thought nothing of them. They gave off no heat, only bright light. He rose higher. Mountains shrank and oceans grew. Great clouds of white like the bloom of cottonwood trees hid the solid ground from view. Still higher he flew.
He turned and fear floated before him. It was vast. The mindless terror seized him as the void starred into him with countless glittering eyes. There were worlds upon worlds, stars upon stars—and great voids between. The size and scope defied his imagination. To look was to be lost. To see was to invite blindness, madness, and death.
In a panic he clawed his way back. He awoke, shocked at his fear, surprised to find himself in his sisters’ tent. The dream faded into the darkness. Of course, he couldn’t fly. At least that part was a shame. He laid back down on the cot and fell back asleep, disappointed—a common feeling after a flight dream.
When he woke again, it was morning and he was too hot and sweaty to roll over. He sat up and put his feet on the ground and groaned. He swore several muttered curses through gritted teeth as he pulled on his pants and stomped into his boots. “This is feathered ridiculous.” No amount of gold was worth the pain. I need a new line of work, he thought as he left the tent to enter the glare of an overly hot Woolad spring morning. But he knew he was being ridiculous. He was a glass man through and through. Nothing was going to change that now.
The day boiled like summer. A crystalline morning-blue filled the sky. Not a single cloud roamed the heavens and even the air between the tents was thin. 
Avoiding the people on the paths as they laughed and called to each other, Tomrin walked with no desire for revelry—not when he was still rubbing his bruises and sleep from his eyes.
He limped to his father’s tent. His mother was inside. She was busy putting away the furniture for travel. “Your father’s at the festival,” she said. “You’ll have to get your breakfast there,” she added.
Tomrin groaned a thank you. He struggled not to rub his chest; no one would think it strange, yet he glanced around all the same. Emy walked up the path. He didn’t need her catching on. She wore what looked like the same white robe as yesterday. He pulled his hand away from his chest and idly adjusted his shirt.
“It’s almost time for me to sing my song.” Emy said. “You are going to go listen right?” 
“I don’t know,” Tomrin said.
“Oh, you have to!” 
“Since you are my favorite sister, I guess.” 
“But I’m your only sister!” Emy squawked. 
Tomrin touched her nose with his finger. “Boop. You are correct, but still my favorite.”
When they reached the gorge, a high pavilion was raised over the stage to protect the singers from the sun. No act was singing. A censor instead had taken the stage, a fact which the crowd was not happy about. The Orish grumbled the hardest. “What happened?” Tomrin asked, but the censor shouted for quiet. 
“Enough!” the black suited Orioles man called out. “Everyone quiet down! Those blaspheming scoundrels won’t be the only ones interdicted! Quiet down!” 
The crowd quieted to a low grumble. Tomrin saw where the man pointed. Near the foot of the stage, three more black clad men with an equal number of slavers stood with four Orish boys in custody. The Orish boys were dressed in women’s clothing. Part of their act? Tomrin wondered. He was certain the censor on the far left had come from the Winged Helm Inn. “They are from Zircos,” Tomrin whispered to Emy. She shushed him with a look. The censor on the stage did want quiet. 
The man on the stage continued. He raised his voice to a bellow, clearly irritated he didn’t get his quiet, only a simulacrum of it as others whispered and talked in low voices against his will. “It is against the law to harbor slaves in Corundum as well as Zircos. When we find you, and you know who you are, the punishment is lashes—one hundred lashes. So if you harbor a slave stop, turn them over tonight, one night only and you will be free of punishment. In addition I see evil amongst! Evil men! Marked men! You harbor them as well. The punishment will be worse. The gods do not take kindly to disobedience. Perhaps it is your husband, or son? Turn them in. If they are found and you are found to have known, the punishment is death. And your soul will forever be cast into the Lake of Fire!”
“A hundred lashes,” Emy whispered. “So many.” 
“Uh, yes,” Tomrin said. He wasn’t thinking about the punishment for harboring slaves. He kept his eye off the man, afraid his fear would betray him. I can trust no one. Not the four boys the censors were making an example of. Not his family. Not strangers. Not even Robles. Nothing has changed, he finally told himself. This was the danger he lived with. Slowly, he rubbed his chest with the back of his left thumb. The metallic scales were growing back. He’d have to burn them off again soon.
The censor left the stage and the man and his cohort marched the culprits up the knoll and past Tomrin.  These boys were clearly nobodies. Three women and two men followed begging the censors for mercy, swearing loudly their boys weren’t runaway slaves. They had the papers. 
“Runaways would avoid notice, not enter a competition,” Tomrin said, loud enough for the censors to hear.
The front man halted the procession. “Who said that?” The man demanded to know. “Who here thinks they knew what runaway slaves would do?” The man was a whip of a man, even skinnier than Rennly. He had a sharp face. His razors sharp eyes slid over Tomrin. Fool. Tomrin wasn’t sure who he meant: the man or himself for opening his big mouth. He worried Emy might implicate him but she stood deathly still. 
“Yes, if they are runaway slaves why risk putting on a show?” One of the two Orish men asked, taking up the argument. 
Clearly annoyed, the censor restarted the procession. He wasn’t going to find his man and the argument wasn’t making him look wise or judicious. The crowd seemed more than ready to turn on the slavers—if not the censors. Armed with Tomrin’s words the Orish men made the black suited man look petty and small for picking on boys, even if they were dressed in ladies’ clothing. 
“Are you out of your mind?” Emy asked when the censors were out of earshot.
“I was wondering the same thing, myself,” Tomrin replied, itching the tip of his nose.
“I thought it was brave to say something,” a voice behind him said.
Tomrin had heard it before—the glow of it made him forget the itch. The voice belonged to the girl Elisah, the judge’s daughter and clerk. She was with her father, Judge Reydal. He did not wear his red judge gown, but wore a simple gray brown suit with a small black cravat tied around his throat. It looked hot and suffocating but he seemed fine with the heat. Elisah no longer wore her wool dress, but a high-necked blue dress laced at the junction of her chin. The dress had yellow polka dots which accentuated her Orioles freckling.  Not a strand of her well-coiffed hair stood out of place. 
“What are you doing here?” Tomrin asked her. 
Elisah smiled at him and answered his artlessly posed question. “I’m going to sing.” 
“Me too.” Emy said. 
The judge spoke, eyeing him. “Tomrin Watersipper. And you must be his wife? No sister?” He extended his hand to Emy. “Jermey Reydal, and this is my daughter Elisah.” 
“I’m Emy.” They shook hands.
Elisah held her own out to Tomrin. Her fingers were long, spotted, and slender. He stared at them a split second before taking them. She shook; he held on. 
“It’s really great you are working to keep the glass shop open,” Eliash said. “From the sounds of it Godly Glassworks will be pumping new money into the community again quite soon.”
“And it’s a shame about your old master,” Judge Reydal added. “I suppose one of Seasargus’ lieutenants will take him home soon.”
“It’s so sad,” Elisah said, touching Tomrin’s arm. “I’m sorry for your loss. Master Lazoloth seemed like a good man.”
“Yes,” Tomrin said. She was right about Master Laz even if he never really thought of him like that. He was a good man. Now he was dead. Eliash removed her hand from his arm.
The master of ceremonies climbed to the stage, taking the steps like a man well chastened. Tomrin thanked him, internally. The man announced the next act by reading it woodenly from his program. 
A Rubish man climbed to the stage and sang his song while the master of ceremonies waited on the wing watching, listening as if expecting to have to cut him off. Tomrin tried to listen but standing next to the judge’s daughter filled him with awkwardness. He could not focus on the machinations of the stage, not until Emy’s name was called and Elisah headed up through the crowd to be closer as well. 
Emy’s song was, sadly, as forgettable as the others, and Tomrin wondered when the competition would be over. The sun was tracking high in the sky, to beat down on his head and shoulders. After her song Emy headed into the crowd bee-lining for her large friend Kam. Finally, the master of ceremonies called Elisah Reydal’s name from the list.
“I wanted a boy,” Judge Reydal said, almost as if to himself as his daughter climbed up the wooden steps of the stage. She began to sing. A hush fell over the crowd. She sang and they applauded when she hit the high notes. Tomrin and the judge, both just listened as Elisah’s voice soared. The words were a language Tomrin didn’t know, but it sounded like High Silvan. It was as if she had become one of the high sprites herself. When she finished, Tomrin had no doubt she had won; he clapped heartily with everyone else.
“She’s amazing,” Tomrin said, thinking he’d heard the song before. 
The judge turned to him and Tomrin saw a tear in the man’s right eye. “I wouldn’t give her up for anything,” Jermey Reydal said, before wiping away the tears. “It’s funny how the gods work.” 
“Yes,” Tomrin agreed. “Funny.” He glanced around for the censors, recalling the name of Elisah’s song. “Wasn’t that Shelia’s Aria?” 
The judge must have caught Tomrin, meaning. “It’s not banned, and these Zircos censors think they are each destined to catch the Lightshy Crow himself. But they are nothing but roving bandits. They will move on.”
Tomrin hoped the man was right. For a moment Tomrin allowed himself to fantasize. A more lovely wife he could hardly imagine. Feather, he chastised himself. I’m a feathered fool.
The master of ceremonies called out Robles’ name but he didn’t arrive. After a quick consultation by the judges in the first row of chairs, the winners were announced. The judge headed down to congratulate his daughter. She had won; Emy had not.
Tomrin left in search of a barber. The young Rubish barber called him by name and was friendly enough. Tomrin, however, found the man’s attempt at conversation unwelcome. He paid the man for his haircut and shave and a small something for his efforts, happy to be away from the infernal talk of weather and the troubles brewing between Zircos and Corundum—straight nonsense. Better if I only knew High Silvan.
He swore at himself for even having his beard and mustache trimmed, certain Emy and his mother would read something into it. Luckily, the festival was largely over now. The campground was clearing out by the time he tromped for the Watersipper wagon. His foot only hurting when he jostled it wrong.
The Watersipper tents were down and Tomrin’s father was folding the smaller tent. Dable made a noise clearing his throat. “You certainly don’t look like a hayseed, now. Go find your sister. We’re ready to leave.”
The oxen, two tired looking beasts, Sally and Milly, were already hitched to the lead wagon. Everything but the last tent was loaded. Tomrin hurried back to the hillock and small gorge. Most everyone had cleared out. Emy was with her friend talking to three boys. One was in his ladies’ dress still. The Orish boy was checking out Kam. Love, Tomrin sighed, rubbing his chin. So young and so foolish. 
“Emy,” he said, interrupting their meeting. “Mom and Dad are leaving.” 
“Already?” Emy said. “Feels like we just got here.” 
Emy was older than he when Sheep Shearing Days had lost any meaning for him. He envied her spirit, her zest for it. “I know,” he said. “Feels like only a single day.” 
Emy said her goodbyes then finally she consented to be dragged away. “I think she’s in love,” Emy said when they reached the top of the hill. Tomrin just grunted and she began listing all the reasons for her suspicion. 
For himself, Tomrin wondered if a boy like him could find love with a pretty young woman—one with a voice to make grown men cry. “What do you think of the singer who won?” he asked during one of Emy’s precious breaths. 
“Oh, Elly? What was her name?—Elisah. She is so lovely. I can’t believe how beautiful she is, and her voice. Cabacaw’s own luck,” she gushed. “I could listen to her all day. She knew who you were.” Emy stopped. “No?” she said, putting a hand on Tomrin’s arm. “You aren’t in love with her are you, Tomrin?” 
“I’d know if I was,” Tomrin said, not lying but skimming truth from his words like cream from cold milk. “But when I say she was the best—you were second best—I don’t want you getting mad.”
“Yes, I was robbed.” Emy said, light and airily. She tossed her hands up with a laugh. 
They continued on to the wagon, and soon Tomrin was riding with his father and family out into the lower steppes. After a couple days practice he’d head back to Menad and face Rennly.
The conversation turned from staves to the deal struck the previous night. Then everyone fell silent with the setting sun. “It feels like we are at the edge of the world,” Tomrin said. The plains stretched shadows with the twilight. 
“I better walk,” Dable said. “I want you to drive the team as hard as you can. We’ll reach your brother in a couple hours. It will be too late tonight. With some training… Then your rematch with Rennly. I wish I could be there.”
Tomrin yawned. He wished dearly not to be, yet with him choosing the time he held the initiative. For now, that was enough.🔖


Chapter 22: Gearthrum’s Chosen
When you are in the middle of nowhere, it is best to keep going.
—An old Peregrine proverb

Low, off to the left, Serathus hung, waxing gibbous—an eye in the sky watching families retire to their wandering lives on the steppes. Tomrin held the reins of the Watersipper family wagon, but Milly and Sally knew the way. They raced straight away from Woolad as fast as oxen could go, the wagon’s wheels groaning against the dusty path which was the Eastern Highway. Tomrin had been a pilgrim once—for a short time, but now this land and its people seemed alien to him. Looking for a feather. So many of them, a full train of them, and so few feathers. And more children every day.
Stars blanketed a strip of the night sky. They and Serathus were the only light. The rolling plains under them appeared dead, a place where life would flee. Nothing but gray land ahead stretched to the dome of the sky. Tomrin remembered the final moments of his dream from the night before. Again he felt the strange smallness. It was as if he was already dead.
Woolad held chaos and darkness. Out here Gearthrum was nothing but darkness. Only a few days, Tomrin reminded himself. He would return to Menad; he would defeat Rennly. Only a few days of training, then he could leave this arid land forever. Then back to glass. 
“What are you thinking about?” Emy asked him. 
This was a hard life and Tomrin would not wish it on his enemies. Maybe Rennly or Fredick. “Rennly,” Tomrin replied. “I don’t understand him. It is like he can’t grow up. Judge Reydal said the censors just want to be the one to catch a Marked Man.” Using the judge’s idea made it easier to say. “But Rennly, I don’t know. He’s different. He’s cracked like untempered glass.” 
“You know his secret?” Emy asked in a whisper. 
“Yes. Still doesn’t explain anything. So he’s envious of me. I swear I don’t get it.” 
“I don’t know either,” Emy said, unhelpfully. She offered nothing further than a large yawn. My own sister doesn’t see me as worthy of a second look. With the scales on his chest it was how it was supposed to be, but it didn’t make Tomrin feel any better.
In time Dable spoke. “Turn here,” he said. “Actually, hop down. I’ll drive the team.” 
Tomrin laid the leather reins across the front board of the wagon and stood up. Grabbing the handle he eased himself down. “And don’t favor your foot. It will just make it worse,” his father added.
“I know,” Tomrin said. “Just stiff.” 
Dable mounted the wagon. “A little stiff never hurt anyone. If you ever got a girl you’d understand.”
“What’s that mean?” Emy demanded.
Tomrin yawned at his mother shushing both her husband and Emy. Hours later, they came to temporary paddocks holding goats, a few sheep, and a handful of oxen and cows. “Hadras!” Dable called out loudly. “The ribbon winners are here!” 
“Tomrin! My brother!” Hadras said, exiting his tent. They shook hands. His brother’s grip was a vice crushing bone. 
“Careful!” Tomrin said, pulling away. “I need those fingers. It is good to see you, Hadras.”
His half-brother wore his hair off to the side in a strange style. Being a pilgrim wasn’t his dream either. He, Dable, and Tomrin set up the tents. 
When morning came, Dable woke Tomrin. “It’s time to get up.” he said, “We’re moving out.” His father started pulling up the stakes of his tent. 
“Going?” Tomrin asked as he rubbed his eyes. “I need to practice staves. That’s the only reason I’m out here.” 
“You’ll practice on the way,” Dable replied and pulled up another stake. “We need to get going. Get up and start helping.” 
“I am up,” Tomrin snapped back at him. Outside the tent, his father handed him a shepherd’s staff. 
“How am I to practice with this?” 
“Not with this; at midday, when the sun is high,” Dable said. “And stop favoring your foot.” He limped away, favoring his own.
“The Lower Steppes have always been dry,” Hadres said after they had traveled an hour. “But this is the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The next day Hadras insisted that he drive the wagon. No one thought to argue. “What the feathers are you doing out here, Tomrin Watersipper?” Tomrin asked himself as the sun ascended towards its zenith. “You are no shephard, even dressed in white.”
“This isn’t very fun,” Emy admitted to him, rejoining him with a wayward sheep.
“No. It has me wondering,” Tomrin said. “Why am I even doing any of it?”
Emy set down a wayward lamb. “What do you mean?” she said. She made no secret that she was unhappy with where they were headed. The New Cold Wellsprings was likely to be deserted.
“Why train? Why bother with any of it?” Tomrin said. “Godly Glassworks is hardly the only glass shop in the world. I could go to the capital. In Corundum I would make three or four times as much as I do in Menad. I’m being silly, not wanting to leave.”
“Oh, don’t go to Corundum!” Emy said. “You would be so far away then.” 
“From this?” Tomrin said. “I’d like to get as far away from this as possible. That’s why I left. Can’t you see it? All this searching for a feather is silly. A lightning bolt striking the sea in the same place twice is more likely. You’re wasting your life out here. I can feel mine dripping away.” 
Emy stopped. “You sound like you hate the gods,” she said. 
“I don’t hate them,” Tomrin said. They continued on in silence. 
Mirages, silvery blue spirits, haunted the Lower Steppes. Finally the old well resolved from the dry murk. Looking from before the Cracking of the World Egg, the well’s stone blocks were pitted with age. Rotting planks of wood covered the top. The lip of the well was the perfect height for a toddler to fall in and die. 
Tomrin and Emy followed the wagons, careful to not let any of the willful beasts in their charge head for the old cistern. To them it still smelled of water, not rot. Clear water ran from the moss covered rocks around the new spring. And while two wide Myrrh trees now grew near the old well—those around the new well had long since drowned. 
 The next morning, Tomrin announced he was leaving. “What about your training,” Dable said.
“I don’t need to be a master at staves, just good enough to beat Rennly.” 
“Sounds like you are going off half-baked again,” Dable said. “You still have a whole day to train, then another to reach Menad.” 
“Perhaps,” Tomrin allowed. He walked over to his brother’s tent. “Hadras, I need to borrow a knife.” 
“What for?” Hadras asked from inside his tent. “Not going to hurt anyone, are you?”
“Not unless it’s Rennly.”
“What?”
“No,” Tomrin said. “But no. I’m not hurting anyone but myself.”
The tent stirred. Hadras’ shadow moved. The flap opened and he handed Tomrin a bone-handled knife. “Don’t do that either,” he said. “You can keep it.”
Tomrin took the knife’s handle. “If I die and Rennly is still alive, watch out. He might be coming for you.”
Hadras spied the air and horizon suspiciously. “Rennly Rickot? Never liked him.”
“Me either,” Tomrin admitted and turned. In case Hadras called after him wanting to know what he had in mind for the knife, he worked up a lie. Cut my finger nails. But Hadras didn’t ask.
The animals were bedding down in their paddocks for the night, safe from coyotes and large cats. It wasn’t exactly safe to be out alone on the steppes at night. Or so it was said. Wild animal tracks lead up to the water’s edge. Out here every nonsense story about blood beasts could be true. I really need to get out of here. In the stark moonlight it was easy to see how people could come to believe such nonsense.
Inside his tent, he tossed the knife on his bed and retied the flaps. Striking a match, he lit the lamp. Dropping the match on the ground, he snuffed it as with his boot, grinding its smoking embers into dry dirt. Taking Hadras’ knife back in hand, Tomrin sat down on his bed. 
The blade looked sharp, but it was still too early to make the cut. The mass of evil in him was so large now it was ready to escape his chest. Reaching into his backpack he pulled out a set of small clothes and tossed them onto the bed. He moved as if in a dream. He didn’t want to do this out here. You should have left last night, a small voice chided. But now he had no choice. With no solid flame nor glass rod to heat, this was going to be terrible. Cutting was bad, and yet he still had to cauterize the wound.
Tomrin knelt down near the lamp. Its flame would have to serve to heat the knife. He began to dig into the dirt. Spilled blood on the ground was a bad idea. Better to bury it. The soil was pebbles, sand, and dirt with a few roots and streamers from the  nearby leathery weeds and grass. Even this close to the springs the steppes grass was sparse and water starved this year.
He waited before the lamp, then moved to his bed and waited again. He tested the knife’s edge against his finger nail. The blade caught against his thumbnail. Hadras kept the thing sharp and freshly oiled.
Convinced the scales could wait another day, Tomrin set down the knife and kicked the mound of dirt into the hole. He laid down. He still had time. His father was right. He could train tomorrow. The Watersipper wagons were here. They were not going anywhere soon.
“It’s time to get going.” Dable’s voice woke him.
“I didn’t sleep.”
Dable batted the side of the canvas tent. “You want to go, or practice, or not?”
“Feathers,” Tomrin swore under his breath. “Fine. Give me a minute.”
Dable gave the tent another good paw. Bwap. “Good.”
Outside the tent, the air seemed cool for the moment, but that would change as the milky sky turned a sapphire blue. Then suffocating heat would bring mirages out onto the steppes.
Tomrin said not a word until after a breakfast of dried blueberries and goat milk. Then he and Dable set about to practice. They walked out beyond the gurgling water of the springs. Tomrin dropped the butt of his staff on the ground and held it with his right hand and waited as Dable used his staff to etch a circle in the rocky soil.
Hadras walked over. “You look like you know how to use that thing, standing like that, my brother,” he said. Tomrin couldn’t understand why his brother addressed him like that. They were step-brothers. Hadras’ real mother died before either of them remembered. But it made no sense not to use his name. 
“When I beat the feathers out of Rennly, I’ll be the kingbird of more than glass,” Tomrin said, hefting his staff with both hands and swinging it down like a hammer, mace, or scepter. Carved as it was, it had the feel of a staff, but definitely no good in a fight.
Dable finished the circle. “Perfect, yet again,” he announced of the ring drawn on the ground, even though Tomrin could see his father had slightly corrected his final few feet to make the circle meet.
Tomrin stepped inside the ring. “You go on the defense.”
“Will Rennly be on the defense?” 
“He will be when I smash him,” Tomrin replied. “I’m done...” He didn’t wait for his father, or for himself to say more, but advanced swinging. His attack had no finesse. Dable let him know as much and Tomrin rubbed his arm where he struck him. 
“You will have to do better than that if you want to put Rennly on the defensive.” 
They settled in to spar. After Dable tired, Hadras took his place. Then Dable yelled at the both of them. No, Tomrin! Hadras, you wool head. Keep your staff up. Keep your head in it. Patience! Work him, work him! Don’t look there. Hold that stick. Step. Step. Step! You have to take a feathered step! 
Dable hobbled into the ring and broke up the clack, clack, clack of their staves. “You are slower than a feathered goat,” he said to Hadras. 
“So?” Hadras asked, thrusting the staff at Dable for him to take. “I’m faster than you, old man.” He left the ring and headed towards the tents and fresh water. He had the right idea. Instead of following him to the water and cool shade of the myrrh trees, Tomrin and his father continued to spar. 
“You could have been a grand champion, the way you were able to win the yellow ribbon,” Dable said when they both tired. 
“I don’t care about ribbons or staves.” Tomrin said. “I just need to beat Rennly. And once only. Then I just have to watch him—to keep him from poisoning my drink.”
“You really hate him, don’t you?” Dable said.
Tomrin shook his head. “It’s not me, Papa. It’s him.”
Back in camp they played Pincushion until the stars came out, all but Hadras who brooded in his tent. When Tomrin begged off another game he returned to his tent. He lit the floor lamp and redug the hole. He waited until he was happy no one was going to interrupt him. The mass was ready to push out of him and be visible to all. Or was it only visible to Daughters? Tomrin didn’t want to find out the hard way. Pulling off his shirt, he picked up the knife. Kneeling down in front of the lamp, he gritted his teeth. With three swift cuts, he sliced the scales from his chest.🔖


Chapter 23: An Old Dead Well
“But in the darkness as black as the holes in space will he still know our names?”
—From Fragment 1402

Tomrin dropped his blood soaked smallclothes into the pit. Sweat coated his body and gave him a chill as he heated the tip of Hadras’ knife in the lamp’s flame. The blood from his chest streamed into his left hand. The red liquid dripped through his fingers into the pit. The blood splattered his removed scales. Gritting his teeth, Tomrin touched the knife to the wound. The pain of touching hot steel to raw flesh drove the breath from his lungs. Blood boiling filled the air. He pulled away the knife. The flame hadn’t heated the blade hot enough to cauterize the wound. “Feathers.”
Thrusting the knife back into the orange flame, the blood on the knife charcoalized. Tomrin needed to hurry. His hand was quickly filling with hot red sliminess. 
He shifted his weight on his knees and the blood in his left hand leaked into the pit. Gently rocking the knife in the flame, he kept it in the hottest part. The charcoaled blood on the tip turned red hot and began to glow. No waiting this time, Tomrin told himself. The knife needed to be as hot as possible. 
One fluid motion, he arched his wrist to press the tip into the wound. He made only a small squeak as he touched the hot knife to his chest. “Err.” The round hole in his chest was larger than a silver penny and he would have to hit it twice, maybe three times to staunch the flow. The idea made him winch. More blood splashed into the pit.
He pulled the knife from the wound and again the triangle of flesh gushed blood, just like the rest of the wound. His blood leaked through his fingers and over the side of the cup he made with his left hand. It ran down his chest, ruining his small clothes. He was going to have to throw them in the pit as well. Disgusted, he dumped his blood out, flinging it into the shallow pit. 
“Feathers,” he muttered. It was only a flesh wound, but the cut bled like it was a puncture. He clapped his hand over his heart and held in the leakage. Cauterizing the wound wasn’t working. His hand held awkwardly on his chest, he stood up and dropped the knife. 
Too sharp? He ran through the possibilities in his mind. Or too dull? Maybe it was the tarsk he drank at dinner, or maybe the sheer size of the wound. The last time he’d cut the Leviathan’s Mark the scales were fewer in number and individually smaller. 
He stood for several minutes holding his chest until his arm grew tired, then he held his left hand in place with his right. He waited several minutes. He took his hands away from the wound. It continued to bleed as before. A clot refused to form. He tore a strip from his shirt, getting blood all over it and on his backpack. He held the strip of cloth to the wound. It sopped full of blood.
He threw the strip into the pit and used the rest of the ruined shirt. But it also sopped with blood. When blood began to stream from the bundled up shirt he returned to just holding in his blood with his bare hands. That way at least he was able to reduce the flow to a small dribble. His small clothes were drenched, but he couldn’t worry about that. He had to stop the bleeding.
Cauterizing the wound hadn’t worked. I made a mistake? He tried it again and failed again. He hoped it was the tarsk making him unstable on his feet. 
“At least it is gone for the moment,” Tomrin muttered to himself of the evil inside his chest. It, however, was certain to grow back. Sitting down on his bed. He wondered at the sheets. They, like him, were splattered with blood.
He was certain to be discovered now, just a matter of time. He tried to think but dizziness distracted him, making it hard to focus on anything. Set the tent on fire? But that wouldn’t fix the fact that he was still bleeding. 
He looked down; he had dropped his hand from the wound. Blood drained quickly from the cut. His heart beat faster. “You need help,” he told himself. 
At the flap strings, his bloody fingers fumbled the cords. The tips had gone numb. Slippery blood made it hard to work the strings. Knife. Retrieving it, he cut the strings. He dropped the knife, revolted at how alien it felt in his hands.
He rubbed his hands together trying to bring back some feeling as he ran. The wound! The thought brought his left hand back up. He hurried to his father’s and mother’s tent. He stood surprised when he found himself outside it. 
“Mom. Dad,” he said, blinking. “I need your help.” He wasn’t sure if the warbling voice he heard was his, but those were the words he’d wanted to say. Not wanted—needed. “I’ve cut myself...pretty bad.” 
The groggy sound of his parents waking reached him through the fog. He couldn’t believe this was happening. “Yes, it’s me,” he replied to his mother’s indistinct question.
“Put on your robe, Dable,” Janet said. “For heaven’s sake.”
Dable’s fleshy form appeared at the flaps of the tent. “Uh,” he said. “You look like you were attacked by a bear.” Dable took Tomrin’s arm and pulled it from his chest. 
“It’s not my arms,” Tomrin said as his chest gushed blood.
“Oh, Tomrin, dear gods,” Dable said, letting go. “Janet!” The fear in his father’s voice was enough to scare Tomrin back to his senses. He clamped his hand back over the wound. 
Janet Watersipper exited the tent a moment later. Her robe hung loosely over her like a small tent. Tomrin flinched when she grabbed him. “Oh, my poor baby. You’re covered in blood!” He slipped from her grasp and sat on the ground.
Fear of death kept his hand in place on his chest. He could barely feel the beating of his heart. He looked at his other hand like he’d never seen it before, then turned his head to the sky. It was clear. Piercing light, stars, throbbed with his heartbeat. They were beautiful, pristine, and pure, everything he was not. 
“In the chair, I need to look at you.” Dable pulled Tomrin up and dumped him into a slatted travel chair. He lit a floor lamp. “Pull your hand away.” 
Slowly Tomrin complied, confused. His hand was the only thing keeping his blood in. “I don’t—” he said, losing his train of thought. Dable’s green eyes said he was in trouble. Tomrin racked his brain for all the problems he now had, but couldn’t. He only knew this one was serious. Worse than serious. The worst. 
Dable replaced Tomrin’s hand over the wound. “Did you stab yourself in the heart?” 
“No,” Tomrin said. “Why would I do that?” 
Janet brought Emy and Hadras. Emy hugged Tomrin’s head but Hadras asked the real question. “What do we do now?” His mane of hair was a mess on his head. 
“Why did you hurt yourself, Tomrin?” Emy whined. 
“How did he?” Dable asked. “How did you hurt yourself so badly?” 
“Knife,” Tomrin said. “This wasn’t supposed to happen. Such a fool.” He saw how he should have held the lamp’s flame directly to his wound. That might have worked. 
“My knife?” Hadras demanded. “You did this with my knife?” 
“Yes,” Tomrin said. There was no point in lying about it now. 
“You said you weren’t going to hurt anyone.” Hadras said, “That’s my old sacrificial knife. It’s covered in bleeding toxin.”
“That? No.” The bloody knife wasn’t triangular at all. 
“Get it, Hadras,” Dable said. 
Hadras returned with the knife. “And look at this,” he said breathlessly, his breathlessness not only from running. He held a wet patch of bloody scales. Emy squeaked at the sight. Shame pushed sweat out the pores on Tomrin’s face. 
“The Infernal Scales of the Leviathan,” Dable said and Janet jumped to her feet letting go of Tomrin’s hand. 
“Oh, the sweet gods,” she said, and turned away. “The evil. He tried to hide the evil. I can’t believe my baby is... You used to be such a perfect little baby. You never even cried.”
Dable stopped her hysterics. “We need to sew him up. A thread and needle. Quick woman!” 
Hadras was inspecting the wound holding Tomrin’s hand away. “I don’t think that’s going to work,” he said, letting go. Tomrin’s hand slapped his own chest. 
“We need a big bandage,” Emy said. 
“Cauterize it,” Tomrin starred. “You have to burn it shut.” 
When Janet returned with the needle and thread, Dable sent her back into the tent for a spoon. “Spoon! Metal!” he shouted to her. Dable handed both needle and thread to Emy. “We still might need them.”
With the small silver spoon in one hand, Dable turned up a lamp with the other. “Hotter,” Tomrin said. “It has to be red.” His mother turned away. She couldn’t even look at him as she muttered prayers to Seasargus, as if the gods in heaven could help him now. “Hotter!” Tomrin said when Dable pulled it from the flame. 
“It’s as hot as it’s going to feathered get!” Dable said. 
“Oh, sweet Seasargus,” Janet wailed. 
Dable brought the spoon close to Tomrin’s hand. “Move your hand.” 
“No, it has to be hotter.” 
Dable turned his head to Hadras, “Grab his arms.” 
Tomrin removed his hand. “Fine,” he said and Dable pushed the spoon’s cup against the wound. “Ahh!” Tomrin cried and Dable removed the spoon. “It has to be hotter. Feathers!” The wound still bled but his head cleared. Dable frowned and held the bloody spoon back in the flame. “The blue of the flame is the hottest,” Tomrin told him weakly.
Soon the spoon began to glow a dull orange. “It’s hot now.” Dable said, pulling the spoon from the flame. Tomrin unclamped his hand. The glowing spoon filled his vision. Dable pushed the thing into the wound. 
Tomrin smelled burning flesh as pain dimmed the lamp. He heard his brother and sister speaking as if they were deep inside a cavern. “I can’t believe my brother is the Lightshy Crow,” Hadras said. “I think we killed him,” added Emy. 
There was a loud screech as darkness overtook Tomrin… His hands turned to glass, light and brittle. Then his feet were transmuted into that same brittle substance. The sky above was pure white now and the ground was black as coal. Red birds patrolled the skies above and green snakes slithered in and out of the dark earth. Tomrin tried to run but couldn’t. The snakes slid close. The birds swarmed. As they dived Tomrin tried to bat them with his hands and arms, but his appendages refused to move.
He turned his head and saw a demon staring at him. It scowled, staring at him with curious eyes, a dark intelligence in them. “Are you the Crow?” it asked. Its voice was of an old man’s, breaking and creaking, like it were the crow it sought. “I am here for the Crow.” 
“No!” Tomrin shouted and beat his wings against the pinions fettering him to the cross bar holding him up. He arched his head back to yell. 
He came awake with a start. He was on his back.
“He’s awake,” Hadras said.
Tomrin bent his neck to look at his wound. A white bandage of cashmere wrapped  his chest. Only a small drop of blood seeped through. The muttering sound of prayer ceased. He tried to move his arm. Coarse canvas rope bound them. He sat up as his family huddled around him. “Why are my hands tied?” he asked. His legs were tied as well. He felt thirsty, empty, and tired as if he had run all day in the heat without water. “Untie me.” His chest itched and stung. He rubbed it with his bound hand. 
“Don’t do that. You’ll tear it open again,” his father said, grabbing his arms. “Is that what you are trying to do?” 
“No, I’m not trying to tear anything. I’m trying to scratch,” Tomrin said. The rope was cutting into his wrists and he couldn’t understand how his father was afraid he was going to hurt himself. It was nonsense. He had the glass shop to run. “And I need sleep if I am to make it back to Menad in the morning.” 
“You’ve been cutting the Mark of the Leviathan from your chest,” Janet Watersipper said. 
Tomrin closed his eyes. Yes, they knew—of course, they did. “Yes,” he said. “But don’t tell anyone.” 
“But you have to be purified,” Emy said. 
“No, I don’t. Master Laz didn’t; he lived for years.” 
“And look what happened to him,” Dable said. “In the morning, I’m going to Woolad for censors. It is death otherwise.” 
“You don’t have to say anything. How would they find out?” Tomrin reefed against his bonds. “I want to live free. I don’t need Purification. The gods are liars. Are you so blind? Staying was a mistake; coming home was a mistake.”
“Tomrin, you are scaring me,” Emy said as Hadras stood and backed away. 
“I’m sorry, Emy,” Tomrin said. “But I will not be bound like an animal for sacrifice.” He stared at her, then glanced at the others. He could not read their shadow-darkened faces. “Just let me go, forget me, but let me live as I choose.”
“But the gods—” Janet said. 
“I don’t give twisted feather for the gods!” Tomrin roared. “If they are so powerful, why let the Leviathan break the Gaze Between the Worlds or Crack the World Egg? Tell me that! You can’t, because The Book of Light is nothing but lies.” 
Janet Watersipper made the Sign of the Tree. “You were right,” she said to her husband. “It was wise to bind him. The demons have my baby.”
Tomrin bent at the waist and began untying his feet. Dable grabbed him by the hair and snatched his hands away. “The gods will decide your fate,” he said and let go of Tomrin’s hair and grabbed both his arms. “Hadras get his feet.”
Tomrin flopped like a dying fish and yelled at them to stop. “Don’t touch me!” 
“Where are we taking him?” Hadras asked as Tomrin yelled at them to let him go.
“The old dead well,” Dable said. “And get two shepherds crooks,” he added to Emy and Janet. 
“Why not just tie him to a tree?” Emy asked. 
“Obey your father,” Janet Watersipper said. 
Hadras dropped Tomrin’s feet when Tomrin flopped again. Hadras stared at them. “Seems better than the old well,” he said. 
“And do you want to be out here guarding him when Serathus sets?” Dable said. “Now grab his feet; we need to hurry.”
Dread overrode Tomrin’s anger. “You don’t have to do this; I’ll be good, I promise.” His father didn’t seem to hear him. He and Hadras half-dragged, half-carried him to the old well. Tomrin felt dizzy. The spinning and lurching of the sky made him want to heave whatever was left of dinner from his stomach. He forced down the bile that came into his mouth as Dable and Hadras pushed the rotting cover off the pitted stones. 
Tomrin tried to scramble away, but he was drained of strength and his muscles refused to work. Cold air poured from the waiting hole in the ground next to him.
“Now, hold still,” Dable said. “Or you’ll do an injury to yourself worse than you’re already done.” 
Emy and his mother arrived with the staves. Dable and Hadras lifted him up, a staff under each arm. They swung him over the edge of the well and pushed his legs in. Starlight looked up at Tomrin from the shallow water at the bottom. His step-brother and father lowered him towards the yawning blackness. 
His feet hit the inch of water on the bottom and he wrenched against the staff under his right arm, pulling it with a jarring motion, ripping it from Hadras hands. Both Hadras and Dable cursed. Hadras cursed the staff, Dable his son. “You feathered idiot, Hadras.” 
Tomrin tried to pull the other staff from Dable’s hands, but his grip, like his mind, was more sure. Dable jerked on the staff and Tomrin’s chest wound felt like it tore open. “Ahh!” he screamed and the staff slipped under his arm and his father pulled it back up. 
“You got your clever side from me, Tomrin,” Dable said. “Once you are purified, you’ll understand all this has been for your own good.” 
“What about the other staff?” Hadras asked. 
“He can’t do anything with it,” Dable said. “Help me close the well up.”
They disappeared and Tomrin checked his wound. The bandage was filling with new blood. “Help me,” he said weakly as the cover eclipsed the stars above. “The wound tore open.” The plink of small bits of wood and sand hitting water was louder than him. Then there was pure darkness. 
Slowly, Tomrin sank to the ground. The cold began to leach into him. He tried to grab the staff, to pull it into his lap but strength escaped him. It was useless. Everything was useless now. 
Soon his thirst built. He rolled over and sucked sandy water from the bottom. The water tasted of mold and something else—rotting skeletons?
His thirst slaked for the moment, he tried to untie his feet and ankles. He gave up swearing. He couldn’t see a feathered thing. 
He inched his way to the side of the well. A lip existed between the blocks, but bound as he was there was no hope of climbing out. He turned and put his back to the cold brick and sat back down. He hated the heat, but the cold was no comfort. With no escape, the night grew colder than cold.🔖


Chapter 24: The Lightshy Crow
And what of him and what of his companions? 
They shall shine bright against the darkness,
And the heavens shall count them aplenty. 
— From The Dark Verses

A brittleness filled him. Soon he would crack. His teeth would shatter and his bones would break. His heart would freeze. Tomrin’s blood slipped out and fused with the darkness of the well. Desperate to slough the brittleness, he pulled his knees to his chest and reached out with his hands to the ropes at his ankles. Like rotting tree stumps, his fingers worked the ropes. The coarse fibers bit his fingertips. He couldn’t see a feathered thing he was doing. 
Afraid the brittleness would consume him, he scooted like a worm to a bar of starlight streaming through the slats above. Here white starlight streamed in bright as a torch. The light didn’t burn the rough canvas rope on his legs, but he could see well enough to untie the knot on his leg. A Hadras special. His first bit of luck. 
He pried on the knot until it loosened and he was able to work it free. When finally free, he massaged his ankles where the rope had cut into him. His feet splashed up water and echoed as he stood and walked around the well. He searched the walls with his tied wrists, desperate for a way to climb out. The gaps between the blocks made him think he could use them for hand holds—if he could find a way to free his hands.
He tried rubbing the rope on the gaps, the sharpest he could find, but quickly tired. He was too weak. It was going to take everything just to climb out. 
“I still have time,” he told himself, even though time was quickly slipping away. He still needed to fight Rennly to save the glass shop. One thing his father had said of the old-moneyed gentlemen, they wanted to see everyone meet their obligations. They had made that much clear.
Tomrin swore at them and at Rennly as he collapsed to sit once more in the water. It seemed colder now and Tomrin forced himself to his knees. He began searching the ground at the bottom of the well for something to cut the rope. Rocks in the silt had long since lost their sharpness. When he found a bone, he hoped for a moment it was the hilt of a knife, a blade still attached, but it was just as useless as the rounded rocks littering the bottom of the well. He dropped the bone back into the water. Splink.
What was Hadras thinking, putting bleeding toxin on a regular belt knife? Everyone knew a sacrificial knife had to be triangular. “I am my own sacrifice now,” Tomrin said, laughing through chattering teeth. He pulled at his rope until he worried his arms might crack in two as the skin split under the rope. Finally the pain forced him to stop his thrashing. He checked his chest wound. He was still slowly bleeding to death. He tried to put pressure on it, but his father’s knot on his wrists made it all but impossible to press hard. 
Each breath came shallower. He could tell he was suffocating. He tried to let go of breathing. He wasn’t trying to die, but if sleep came, death would come with it. He figured life prolonged the agony. His eyes fluttered closed, then popped back open.
The starlight dimmed; shadows reared. For a time he floated above his body before merging with the darkness. This was all that was left of him. Defeating Rennly and running the glass shop were gone. The dead had no dreams, no hopes, no joys, and that was what he was. He was a spirit now. He was not the Kingbird of Glass. He was not the kingbird of anything. When dragged before Seasargus, he would have nothing to show for his disobedience. Less than Master Laz, that was for sure.
Suddenly, the Luster called to him. Taste me, it said. Then you can destroy anyone who stands in your way.
Tomrin forced himself back into his body and willed his heart to beat. Ka-thud. Ka-thud. Ka-thud. He was standing now, but unsure how he had regained his feet. Burning bars of sunlight drenched the ropes which bound him. Somehow dawn had come. Who are you, Tomrin Watersipper? A small voice asked him. He feared he knew the answer and he did not like it. He squinted at the braids twisted about his wrists. “I—” he muttered, unsure of himself. “I can’t be the Lightshy Crow.” 
His voice echoed through the well. It echoed in his ears and it echoed in his head. He became more sure of himself. Weren’t the fetters on his wrists but fibers of braided canvas, crude and flammable. Time itself would rot them to dust. They were nothing; nothing compared to the awesome power in the Wellspring—just grab it. He could command the regrowing mass of twisting evil inside him. He could direct it at the knot and it would have no choice but to give way to him. He could pull down the well cover. He could cast it into fire, or shatter it with ice. He could set fire to the steppes. Or not. He was greater than that. He could tear down tyrants and set up empires. The seas would boil at his command. He could crack Serathus open like an egg and crush his enemies like insects they were, yet none would dare to oppose him. He was fear, and he was death. The gods themselves would bow down before him.
Fire, ice, shadow, and a fluid akin to strength of will flowed through him. The four ambrosia he’d read about chocked his arteries full as the mass in his chest under the scales expanded, a great sword unsheathed in anger. It was a sail unfurled in a great storm. It expanded out from him. It had never been small, but coiled like a monstrous snake. Now it expanded out into the far reaches of space.
Great chaos covered everything. It overlaid Gerthrum, Serathus, the stars, and all the vast emptinesses in between. He alone stood at the center, a prescient beacon of fire. The Wellspring lay all around, up and down, and side to side, filling everything, himself included.
Liquid ice filled it. And where there was ice, there was fire. All was masked in shadows, each casting shadows of their own. The three were woven together by countless threads of a fourth substance.
All four burned in his veins as he glowed brightly. The strands of power ripped through him, and he glowed brighter as he netted up the ice and shadow in the wilful threads. Willvane. The name made sense now. With it he shrank the ice and shadows to nothing, leaving only sunfire burning within.
Sweeping his hands, he cast the fire out through his wrists. Fire flared as it burned the rope. Fwat. The light blinded him. “Ahh!” he cried as sunfire burned more than just the rope. The smell of charred flesh filled the dank air. Then as quick as the green light had found and left him, the Luster fled, taking his second sight with it.
Tomrin pulled free of the burning rope. The fire at his wrists had shifted to his hands and had come out his palms. Now they burned like he had hammered freezing spikes into them. Despite the fire’s intense power, Tomrin saw it behaved in subtle ways. With a popping sound, it had uncoiled wildly. He blinked at the bright afterimage as he probed his palms with his fingertips. When he inspected them in the bar of sunlight he saw the fire had cooked his skin to a chalky white ash. The burns themselves were thin as his fingernails but the surrounding flesh was pained from the heat. “Feathers,” he muttered, licking the burns. 
Picking up his brother’s staff, he hung its crook over his shoulder. Slowly, he scaled the wall. Finally, his head brushed the cover. Holding the wall with one hand, he pushed his other hand up and under the lid, then thrust the cover off the stones. Daylight spilled pain into his eyes. He waited for sight to return before climbing the last bit out.
Dirt covered the bandage around his chest. His small clothes were filthy. Brushing at the mess with one hand, he stood with the help of the staff in his other. For a second he pondered the crook. The way the fire curved in the Wellspring, and how it burned and coiled, the staff might prove useful with its crook acting like a lens.
The sky was a cloudless blue. Another hot one, Tomrin thought as he headed for his tent. Emy stood outside of hers. “Good morning, Emy,” he said to her. “I think the bleeding stopped,” he added, glancing at his bandage. When she didn’t say a word, he leaned his staff against his tent and ducked inside. His hands sweated. Salt attacked the burns on his palms. At least it isn’t bleeding, he thought as he sat and began to change. There was blood everywhere but the clothes in his backpack were still clean.
Stripping the bandage off his chest, he slipped into a pair of pants and tucked his feet into his boots. Voices outside rose as he stomped into them. Emy was talking. She certainly liked to talk. The thought brought a smile to Tomrin’s face. “There is something wrong with him. I know it,” she said.
“And he is in his tent?” Dable asked.
Tomrin stepped outside, pushing the tent flaps out of the way. Not just Emy and Dable, his whole family was walking towards him. Hadras flipped his hair to the side.
Dable’s voice had said he didn’t believe Emy, but now he spoke almost shrilly. “Where do you think you are going, Tomrin?”
It felt strange not wearing his shirt. The scales were gone—it would take several more hours for them to show any growth, but the wound was there, angry and burnt, proof they had been cut off. He touched the mass of angry flesh around the scorched scab as he thought about his father’s question. “I guess—” Tomrin said, confused by the question. “I guess I’m getting ready to leave.”
His father eyed the staff. It was as close to him as it was to Tomrin. “Leave for where?” his father asked, his voice strained. Tomrin squinted at him and the others. He could see fear in everyone’s visage but Hadras’. His brother’s eyes held curiosity, a rare thing for him.
 “You wouldn’t try to stop me, would you?” Tomrin said. The idea sounded ridiculous now.
“Are you going to leave wearing only pants and boots?” Dable asked. He took a step forward. His step put him closer to the staff. 
Tomrin held up his hand. He didn’t want to have to hurt his father. It was the lies of the gods which had made him and his family do what they had done. “You shouldn’t try to stop me,” Tomrin said. “Come with me. You all can come. But we must hurry,” he added. He nodded at the animals. “Someone will have to stay to help Hadras drive them in, but for now, they will only slow us down.” 
“Are you going to turn yourself in?” Emy asked.
“What? No,” Tomrin said. “No one is turning anyone in. That is all over.” 
“Is it really?” Dable said, squinting.
“Yes. I am returning to the glass shop.”
“Don’t be arrogant, Tomrin,” Janet chided.
“I am not. And don’t tell me what to do. I am no longer a child, but a man.” 
“Then act like one,” Dable Watersipper said. “Take responsibility for what you are. The gods will punish us! Us!—if you aren’t purified.” 
“The gods are nothing but toothless birds worried about their feathers. If you are so afraid of them, hide. Stay here in this waste, but I have no more patience for it. I am not evil because I am Peregrine, no more so than for the Mark.”
Dable went for the staff. He snatched it from where Tomrin had leaned it against the tent. Tomrin moved without thinking. One moment he was a step or two away from the staff, the next step he held onto the staff as well.
His father was stronger, but when Dable tried to strike him with it, Tomrin slowed the swing, stopping it from connecting. Dable puffed and sweated while Janet yelled at the both of them to stop. Tomrin dodged the next dampened swing. The third, he played into, dragging his father off balance and into the tent. 
Dable landed on his canvas crushing the tent. Janet rushed to her husband. “I hope you’re happy!” she wailed as she helped Dable to sit up. “You’ve hurt your father!”
Tomrin picked up the staff. He didn’t feel happy or sad, but angry. Trying to reason with his family was a waste of effort. He was getting nowhere with them. “You have to turn me in so you can stay here living in this wasteland? See what your greed has bought you? Waste your lives here, never to leave until you find a Serath’s feathers!”
“Never leave until we find a feather?” Dable demanded.
“Or come with me now,” Tomrin said, holding out his hand to his father.
Janet helped Dable to his feet and they stepped off the fallen tent. “Who are you to dictate to me?” Dable said, balling a fist and shaking it at Tomrin. “I made you!” 
Tomrin worried what he might do as confusion floated across the surface of his own anger. “Who am I?” he shouted as the Luster gripped him. He quoted The Dark Verses. “The wind stops, and mountains kneel at what the mists conceal. The earth quakes, and hearts break. The light fades; the dead walk in his shadows made!”
His mother gasped.
Tomrin drank from the Wellspring: fire and ice, and shadow and will. He was great, and they were terrible—and it was glorious. With both hands he held the staff high. “I came into this desert to master the staff,” he said. Ambrosia swirled in his veins. “And I have done it!” He wove as he channeled. The ice, shadow and will became nothing, but the fire he cast into the staff as he lowered it, the crook in his right hand. The butt of the staff he hammered into his canvas tent. Fire burst from the staff except for where he held it. The fire roared and he shouted as he cast. “Who am I?” he screamed. “What am I? What is the Lightshy Crow?” he shouted! His family scattered, backing away from him, and from the burning tent.
Tomrin shadowed his face with his arms and stepped back from the burning tent himself. The second sight faded and he lost sight of the Wellspring. Now I really do need their help. To burn his pack and clothes was foolish. He touched his pocket. The billfold was in his other pants. It and all the bankdraws and his patents were burning. Tomrin thought about the money for only a moment. What he needed was a shirt, and some food and water. “You will help me, now?”
“What do you want?” Dable asked, keeping his distance. Janet and Emy hurried next to him. 
“I need a shirt,” Tomrin said. 
“We don’t wear shirts,” his father said stubbornly. 
“I have a shirt,” Hadras said. 
“Thank you, brother,” Tomrin said. “Go get it.” Tomrin continued as Hadras ran to his tent. “And a water bag and something to eat.” Dable nodded to Emy and Janet and they hurried away. 
“And that’s it?” Dable said. 
“No,” Tomrin replied. He glanced over to an old myrrh tree. It had a gnarled branch he wanted. “Help me make a walking stick?” Tomrin walked with his father to the tree. It already smelled in the morning heat. “This branch,” he said to his father. “It is almost perfect for my design.” 
“And what design is that?” Dable asked when Tomrin directed him to break it such that its double crook was preserved. Dable broke the branch and began straightening the ends with his belt knife.
“My designs?” Tomrin mused. “I’m not exactly sure, but it seems the first thing I have to do is fight Rennly to save the glass works. Then, who can say?” 
Dable tucked away his knife, and held out the walking stick. “My son, the Lightshy Crow.” There was a touch of pride in his voice. 
Hadras hurried back with a tallow-colored nightshirt. Tomrin didn’t raise the hood over his head when he put it on. The water skin from Emy, he slung over his shoulder. Then with his walking stick in one hand and a dried flat cake in the other, he said his goodbye. 
“You could stay with us,” Emy said. “You could find a feather. The gods would forgive you too then.” 
Her sadness filled Tomrin and he glanced away to the lonely horizon at his left. “I’m afraid you will have to find your own feathers. Now that you have all helped me, you can’t come back without one.”
“What about Rennly?” Hadras asked.
“Still as true as ever.”
“What about Rennly?” Emy asked, but Hadras hushed her.
Leaving them, Tomrin marched west for Woolad, hoping to make Menad by sundown as per the contract. Soon his foot stopped aching, and he was able to walk without a limp. He didn’t have time to limp. Each moment the sun grew higher in the east. 
The lonely plains of the lower steppes concealed both life and death. Bones washed clean by scavengers sunk into the soil as they cracked. A buzzard hawk, or maybe it was a turkey vulture, circled as it wobbled overhead. Insects, large beetles with black shells, worked scattered dung left by nomad animals.
The burning sun arched overhead and every beetle he saw might have been any other. Only in different stages of life. Just like glass, as deep as he could see, there was more. All he knew was the surface. Just like the Wellspring. His understanding was intuitive, but under the surface what lurked? Tomrin could see now he was but a novice. Lightshy Crow or not, he needed to know more.
As he neared the Eastern Highway, his pace lagged as he pondered what he saw in the Wellspring. There was another beacon in the Pond directly in front of him. Was the beacon another person? He suspected if he could see them, they could see him. As lonely as he felt, the thought offered him no comfort at all.🔖


Chapter 25: Ripples on the Pond
For we have wove a path of darkness; 
And I fear we shall see the end of days.
—From Fragment 616

Farms near the side road squatted. They were short affairs overlooking rolling fields which should have sprouted wheat or barley, or alfalfa or cabbages, or whatever seeds the farmers had planted. Instead, the birds were gone with seeds this year. For the farmers, it was a mercy there was no wind, what with the stale, hot air of summer come too soon. 
Tomrin waited until the dusty strip of road cleared of traffic before he broke from the line of shrubs to enter the highway. He wasn’t exactly sure why he needed to avoid being seen—something from a tract maybe—but he kept his eyes on the road, and his mind on the light in the Wellspring. 
His own movements seemed to stir up vortices in it. He wasn’t sure. It was hard to tell with the chaos which possessed the Wellspring around him. Switching hands with the walking stick, he walked the road, heading toward Woolad, and towards the other beacon. He wished he knew what it meant, what or who it was. He couldn’t quite tell if it was moving or if it was just him and the curve of the road. 
A couple of miles out, he figured he would have to stop for sure to gain a reference. As he approached his Woolad, his unease grew. The farms pushed closer together here. Often he could glance down into them and see lone trees and outhouses, other times there was nothing but embankment. Further south and north the farms were larger. Here the fields were not much larger than three or four intown plots. No one waved or called to him. He tried to remain inconspicuous. 
A mile out, he was certain the light in the Pond was moving towards him. What are the chances? If he was the Lightshy Crow, what did it mean? If the beacon was something like a False Daughter, or even a real one? Then what? Tomrin worried the man from the porch on his left might recognize him and he quickened his pace. 
The old quarry road was just ahead. He turned onto it. Don’t run, don’t run. The road carved north around town. For stretches Tomrin snuck peeks into Woolad. He hoped he might be able to see whoever was tracking him. Worried they might see him, he pulled the hood of his brother’s nightshirt over his head. If I can see them, they can see me.  They wouldn’t even need a scope.
Suddenly there was a stirring in the Wellspring. It was similar to when he channeled. He stopped his feet and watched. Tomrin wasn’t sure what he saw. For a minute the willvane rippled. Then just as suddenly the casting stopped, and the light disappeared from the Pond. Who, or whatever it was, simply vanished from the Wellspring. 
Leaning on his walking stick, Tomrin stood for a moment staring, stunned. Uneasy silence sprouted stalks of doubt. What just happened? What did it mean? His doubt forced him to question his readiness to return to Menad. Things were happening he didn’t understand. I don’t know anything, he realized. Daughters, False or true, both were practiced in their arts. He was not.
He ran, not bothering to use his walking stick. Images of Master Lazoloth’s dead eye flashed through his mind. I can’t kill a woman, he thought as he ran. Can I? The idea seemed beyond him, but he certainly didn’t want to find out how far he would go if a Daughter or censor tried to take him captive. A single night in the well had been bad enough.
The Old Quarry Road looped around the town before it rejoined the Eastern Highway. From his vantage point the people on the streets below were small as ants when he stopped again. The group he stared at had one woman and three men in black. At this distance Tomrin struggled to make out their races, but he suspected they were Orioles, perhaps the same censors from the festival.
He lowered his hood as he stared. The three appeared to be looking directly at him. The woman pointed and a glint of sunlight caught off one of the black clad men’s chest. Definitely censors, Tomrin thought, and the woman was almost certainly a Daughter. If her pointing was any indication, she could track him. 
Tomrin’s mind raced as he turned and ran. He would have to lay a trap. He needed to head for the steppes. No, for the mountains. He would pick them off and kill them one at a time. No. All at once. Even the woman? I don’t want to kill anyone! The woman was certainly the one who disappeared from the Pond. How did she do it?
Tomrin’s heart pounded as the day’s heat began to boil him alive. He flung back his hood as he ran. His feet pounded the road, spitting up the dust behind him leaving an obvious trail. She can see me through the hills! It was a terrifying thought. What do I do? He would have to make a stand. He would have to overawe them. Or learn her disappearing trick. Menad would have to wait. The glass shop would have to wait. Feathers! But he could return to make a new glass shop. A better one. He swore as he ran. “Some feathered Corvine Man I’ve turned out to be! Already breaking my promises.”
Past the old quarry, Tomrin looked down into Woolad but didn’t see the women or the censors. They could be anywhere in town, already chasing after him. I need to get to the trees. Trees could slow them down, even if they could not hide him completely from them.
He turned off the Old Quarry Road onto a side road and headed northeast. Farm and timberlands lay between him and the Emerald Mountains. All hope of reaching Menad in time evaporated as he hurried through a field, then another. The trees he headed for were some of the oldest and easy to get lost in. The streams inside the trees were always changing. He stomped through fields he’d only walked by before. 
The first wooden fence he came to he scaled, throwing his walking stick over and jumping from the top cross board. He picked the stick up and sped on, cutting through the harrowed field at an angle. He ran, stutter-stepping to the next field. An Orish slave yelled at him and for his master. Tomrin didn’t stop and the slave didn’t follow. The man was all bark and no bite. 
I should steal a horse. The censors and Daughters would have horses, and his single myrrh branch left him unprepared to face them, especially if they rushed on ahead of him. He bounded over the next fence and landed hard on his foot. Too winded to swear, he picked up his walking stick and looked around. Three women sat on the porch of the nearby farm house. 
Tomrin pulled the hood of his shirt up and over his head. With his walking stick he hobbled away from them, towards the far fence. “Who are you, handsome stranger?” one of the women called to him. 
Tomrin waved with his walking stick in hand, keeping his eyes on the fence. “No one!” he called out. Handsome? Tomrin shook his head. My tail feathers. He hopped the fence and took the side road and headed north, largely straight at the woods.
“Hey! Stop, stranger!” It was the woman, sounding breathless. She had run after him! Tomrin pulled his hood further down as he turned. “Are you hurt, why are you running through our field?” the woman demanded. She was a handsome young Rubish woman, kissed by the sun. She was, however, a touch more assertive than was healthy for her.
Tomrin held a hand out to stop her. “Halt!” he said loudly. “To follow me is death!” 
“Don’t be silly, Jal. Why are you playing with me, Jal Clar?” The woman said, stepping closer, but more slowly now, a curious cat not sure if the bird she stalked had the larger claws.
Tomrin feared the woman would know him if she got too close, and that she might follow her Jal Clar if he ran. “I am not Jal Clar!” he said. “I am a Feathered Man, woman! Stay back!” 
“Jal!” she said “You sound strange.” The woman took a tentative step forward. “What are you saying?”
The woman’s persistence flipped Tomrin’s frustration to anger. The Luster greeted him like an old friend. He breathed in a heavy breath. He could raise armies of undead minions up to frighten her. Or rain fire from a clear sky. Comets! He could show her the death and destruction awaited her on this path. The Pond was all around, and it was filled to the brim with sweet and deadly ambrosia. He drank in but the tiniest of tiny sips. 
Holding the walking stick at a slant across his body, he cast and wove as one. “Be gone, pest! Do not bother the Lightshy Crow!” Weaving willvane to vanquish the ice and shadow, fire exited him into the staff. It shot out in a flash of light and fire. The woman squawked and the sweet nectar left him. 
Tomrin tamped the burning end of his walking stick into the dirt to snuff it. For a second he worried the woman might die of fright. “Go,” he said. “Run! Hide!” With a scream, the woman turned and ran back the way she came, away from him and from the scent of smoldering myrrh. 
Tomrin didn’t wait to see if she decided to turn back but turned and ran himself, too much precious time lost already. He needed to get to the trees. His stick was shrinking and he cursed it and himself for ever having tasted the ambrosia. Time! That was what he needed. I need time! Then he could find the way to go invisible in the Wellspring. Then he could evade his pursuers. He just needed time. Feathered time!
The road he was on ended at a wooded area near a house in a small hollow. A large elm stood out front. With no path in the trees he would make terrible time through them.  Which way? Tomrin asked himself, but he couldn’t remember if the Calvera place was west or east of the path.  He worried he’d be caught on the other side, trapped if he didn’t take a path through, if his pursuers did. He’d only been out here once before—before the old woman Calvera died. Now the house crumbled in on itself. East or west? Tomrin couldn’t decide. He picked up a flat stone, dirt on one side. “Dirty side go east, clean go west.” He flipped the stone and caught it dirty side up. “East.”
Up and down the rolling hills of the tree line, he hurried, using his walking stick like a cane. Each hill crested brought greater trepidation. You should have gone west. East had to be the wrong way, but he kept at it, unable to turn back now. 
Relief flooded through him when he saw the path he remembered leading up and into the trees. Yet from behind a hillock hiding the road from view, dust boiled from the south. Tomrin hurried down the path. When he entered the trees he glanced back.
Up the road, three censors and a woman rode four horses at a trot. Tomrin thought he could see the gleam of the woman’s silk dress, golden yellow in the sun. Tomrin ran into the woods. Hooves thundered behind him and men shouted like dogs barking on the hunt.
They are hunting me down like an animal. And they had horses. The shouts and the sounds of horses grew closer as Tomrin pushed further into the grove of trees. The path narrowed further. It was a footpath and might stall them some. A man with a sharp Orioles accent shouted. “Dismount!” 
Another voice called out. The pitch was high, a woman’s. “He went in. Be wary.”
“Wary?” a man asked. “Not a chance!”
“Don’t be a fool! He can dance!”
Yes, he can, Tomrin thought as the Luster called to him. He would not be hunted like a wild animal for sport, not for another man’s glory. Not when sun and heat had turned the world to tinder. The leaves of the trees all but begged for fire. All but begged for the match. Was he not the Corvine Man? A Feathered Man In Black? He pulled in the ambrosia. 
The woman yelled shrilly to her men. “Watch out! He’s channeling!”
And so he was. The Corvine Man encased shadow and ice in a shrinking net of willvane. Tossing his walking stick from hand to hand as he switched which side of the path he burned as he set fire to the trees as they stretched out their skeletal fingers out into the path. Choosing curved branches from either side of the path, he lit two columns of flame as he backed away from his pursuers. Branches popped with fire.
He drank more ambrosia, channeling fire, ice, and the shadow and will. He closed the channel before things grew completely out of hand. He only wanted to light a few trees on fire. His pursuers shouted at each other as shards of ice slicked through him. The shadows promised death—his and everyones’. The willvane was bent on wrestling him to the forest floor. His feet stopped as he wove. The power of the shadow and ice seemed too much but he wove. Finally they and the willvane dissipated.
The fire, however, burned inside him. He held the walking stick pointed between columns of fame on either side as the trees burned. The men had stopped, afraid of the inferno which separated them from him. The heat was intense, it pushed right through his shirt and pants. “Stay back,” he said to the men. “I don’t want to kill you!” He shouted to be heard over the sound of the trees spreading their flames and sap pockets bursting.
The woman pushed forward. When she saw his walking stick pointed at her she hid behind the front man. “No one defies the gods!” she said as she raised her head up from behind the front man’s shoulder.
The fire scorched inside Tomrin. He reached out with his free hand and grabbed hold of a drooping branch that curved back in towards the trunk of its tree. He pushed the remaining fire into it. The flaky bark caught fire as raw flame spilled into the tree. He removed his hand and stepped backwards as he held the fire inside the tree, a poor vessel for ambrosia, but a vessel nonetheless. As he spoke he continued to back away. “One does defy the gods!” he shouted at them. “The Lightshy Crow does!” He wasn’t sure she heard him because he lost control and the tree exploded, erupting in fire. CHOOF!
Tomrin turned and ran, swatting burning splinters off his arms and hood. It was a marvel he was still alive. He’d gone from playing with fire, which he feared, to playing with something beyond him. The thought bothered him more than the whole stand burning as he ran headlong through it.
On the other side farmland stretched before him all the way to the Emerald Mountain. To his left, somewhere was Menad nestled between the rolling hills. 
Tomrin glanced back as he ran. Black and gray smoke streamed toward the heavens. He’d bought himself time, but he wasn’t convinced it would be enough. “No,” he scolded himself. “You can’t give up now.” He would escape and make it in time to fight Rennly too. “Somehow.” Some-feathered-how! He put one foot in front of the other as he ignored the pain in his chest and legs.
Ahead, several horses pastured in the distance. Tomrin sped towards them. He drank from his waterskin, not slowing. No money and no bank notes—not that he could use them here—he would have to steal one of the horses and ride it bareback. Tomrin wondered if this was what he had become: a thief, stealing and taking. I only want to borrow one, he reassured himself. And he didn’t even want to do that. A horse would do no good in the rocky crags of the Emerald Mountain. He convinced himself it wasn’t thieving exactly if the beast returned home.
After slipping his walking stick under the cross boards hewn from wavy aspens—white from age as if painted—he half expected some decrepit old farmer to come hobbling out the farmhouse as he hopped the fence. Crouching, he crept over to the nearest horse. 
The nearest horse was a bay and she looked young, maybe a few years old. She was broken to humans and she didn’t shy away when he reached up a hand as if to feed her. She snorted at his hand’s obvious lack of treat and pulled back her head. 
“Whatever girl,” Tomrin said and moved away. She was too flighty for him anyway. What he needed was a nag, a horse which could still move but wouldn’t think to test his abilities as a horseman. Keeping low, he scrambled over the dusty pasture ground to the water trough. Green moss grew on the inside and out. The horse drinking the stagnant water sported a smoky white coat, a gelding of some age. The old boy looked at Tomrin with dull eyes and went back to drinking. “There’s a good boy,” Tomrin said as he patted the pale horse’s front flank. 
He directed the horse with his walking stick over to the gate. Popping the latch he pushed open the wooden gate. He had no choice but to brazen it out. Throwing a glance at the farm house, he led the horse outside into the pasture and closed the gate. Reaching over the gelding’s back with his walking stick in one hand, Tomrin swung up and onto the horse. Old bones poked into his backside.
“This might be quite a ride, old boy,” Tomrin warned the creature and softly nudged the gelding into action. The old thing turned back its head and looked at him. “Go,” Tomrin said, kicking the horse harder. The horse made a surly noise and began to plod away from his paddock. With several more boots to the ribs, Tomrin convinced the gelding to trot. Guiding the horse with his walking stick, he finally pointed the poor thing in the correct direction.
The wind stirred up by the horse felt cool and Tomrin threw back his hood. Fathoms disappeared behind him. He was going to make it. He only had to set fire to the windbreak, scare the daylights out of a woman, and then steal a horse. But he was going to make it.
After a few minutes he stole a glance back. To his dismay, a streamer of dust rose up into the clear sky. How could they be here already? He kicked his horse as hard as he could. “Go!” he shouted at the pale hack under him. But it was no use, the horse was old and already tired. It refused to go any faster. You should have stolen the bay. She had spirit. Probably break my neck on it. But Tomrin bet the young girl knew how to gallop. 
The steamer of dust behind him grew closer and closer. Finally, Tomrin pulled on the gelding’s mane. “Woah! Woah! Stop!” he called. There was no point running the poor beast to death. It wouldn’t help him a bit. His pale horse came to a full stop and Tomrin slid off its back and stretched his legs. He rubbed his backside, trying to control his breath. His rump was going to be sore for days—if he lived that long. 
Walking stick in hand and the horse at his back, he waited. The brown cloud topped the nearest rise and two riders drove their mounts straight at him like they wished to break their necks or those of their horses. One was larger than the other, a man and his dun coloured horse stood nearly twice as tall as the other. The woman’s—for sure it was a woman—was darker skinned than the man. 
The two were the lady Margretta, she on a bay, and her counselor Marten on the dun. It had to be. The woman’s hair whipped back and forth in ruby currents. The Pond roiled around Tomrin, but just like the Daughter which had disappeared, Lady Margretta stirred the Wellspring not even a little. 
Lowering his walking stick as the two pulled their horses to a stop, Tomrin turned to check his gelding. The old boy looked tired and was covered in sweat. “Sorry for that, old boy.”
“Hello, Master Tomrin,” Marten called out as he dismounted.
“Good day!” Tomrin replied.
“Nice to see you are still alive and not killed on this fine spring morning,” Marten said, eying him with a squint.
“Yes,” Tomrin said just as jovially. “It is a fine day for a ride in the country. And a great day to not be dead.” 
The man laughed, and Tomrin found himself laughing too.🔖


Chapter 26: The Walking Stick
And so if you don’t want the flies, don’t kill the spiders.
—From the Living Book of the Dead

With her blue riding dress split to her hip, Margretta slid off her horse as elegantly as any lady. Her bay’s reigns, she let drop. She wasn’t on the ground a second and she was pulling off her leather riding gloves. Those at least she had rolled down. Flinging back her red hair, and without looking, she handed Marten her gloves. Her piercing blue eyes glinted like flinty glass as she stared at Tomrin, a cat wary of its prey. The way she was staring, he wondered if he was going to have to use his walking stick after all. 
“Tomrin Watersipper,” she said. “I see you didn’t receive my warning. I knew I should have delivered it myself.” 
“I received it,” Tomrin said, glancing at Marten. The woman’s ire seemed misdirected, but the Orish man at her side stood impassive as if this were a courtroom and it was not yet his turn to speak. The man also did not wear his vest, but a leather jerkin, dark pants, and boots. It was not a uniform Tomrin had seen, but he knew he wasn’t seeing the pleasant, able-bodied lawyer but the soldier. At his hip, a large dagger, hung in a triangular black sheath. It looked like a sacrificial knife should, but it was far too large. The hilt sported a green gem which gazed up from an ivory orb. 
“You received it?” Margretta said. “You might have heard it, but you obviously didn’t receive it.” Her voice was not shrill, but there was a harsh edge to it and an inhuman indifference to her ire. “Now, I must deal with the consequences.” She stepped towards Tomrin.
He took a step back, or tried to. The front quarter of his stolen horse stopped him. The horse made a questioning sound and Tomrin raised his stick slightly. “What consequences are those?” 
The woman suddenly looked every bit a lady. She was a warrior princess and a Daughter—albeit False. She glared at the walking stick, her irritation evident. “Well for starters, you need to be warded,” she said. “I’m not sure you realize, but every Daughter from here to Menad can see you channeling. Can’t you tell?” 
“I see the churning.”
“Then you know you must be warded, and now. Already Daughters of Heaven’s Glory from here to half-way to the sea are looking for you.” 
Tomrin blinked towards the west. What looked like a cloud had gathered, but it was just the smoke from the burning windbreak. “One Daughter and three censors,” he said and turned back to Margretta. “And this ward will make me disappear?” 
“Yes, it will,” she said and stepped to within striking distance of his walking stick. “I must cast a web on you.” 
Tomrin held up his free hands, forestalling her. “Teach it to me,” he said. “This web of disappearance” 
“That’s not what it’s called.” 
“What is it called?” 
Margretta sighed and Tomrin could tell she was going to be a difficult teacher. “It doesn’t matter what it’s called. We haven’t the time.” 
“Why not?” Tomrin asked. If he disappeared, he could still make it to Menad in time to fight Rennly. He could still save the glass shop. “How long will it take?” 
“Days, weeks, maybe months,” Margretta said. “Maybe you will be a quick study with the willvane as you are with sunfire, but if I were to guess that stick is a crutch and in more ways than one.” 
“I am quick,” Tomrin said, resting the butt end of his walking stick in the dirt. 
“Regardless, the first step is for me to ward you,” said Margretta. “Or do you want to stand here until your new friends arrive?”
“And if I refuse?” Tomrin asked. “Then what?”
Margretta scowled at him. “Already once you have refused my offer of help,” she said. “I don’t know who you think you are, Master Watersipper, thinking you can ignore it now. Gaze into the Darklit Pond. Where can you go that Daughters can’t find you? Already your stunts will bring down Heaven’s fury. The sky will fall on you in a storm of feathers. Meteors of sunfire will burn you down to your skeleton, and comets of glacier ice will crush and scatter your charred and battered bones. That is Master Watersipper, if Heaven were that forgiving. No, they will kill you and interrogate your corpse. But don’t think such could be your fate now. Not now. Not now… Now that we have spoken freely…” 
Marten stepped forward. His hand was on the hilt at his side. “I’m sorry, Tomrin,” he said. “I tried to warn you, not to give into the Luster. You understand. Secrets must be preserved. Lives are at stake. The balance of which is immeasurable.” 
“Lives?” Tomrin said. “All she cares about is her own. She didn’t care about Master Laz’s.” 
“What is one life versus tens of thousands?” Margretta asked. 
“I refuse to think like that. Master Laz’s life meant something.” 
“And he never gave into the Luster, not even at the end, but you have. In this war with Heaven there can be no rogues, no disinterested parties,” Margretta said. “You are with us or against us… And since you already said you want to live...” She cocked her head and raised her eyebrows at him like he was a naughty boy she was unsure what to do with.
Tomrin raised his myrrh walking stick and scratched the itch on his chest. “Maybe it is you who should bow to me,” he said.
Margretta reared back, and looked down her skeptical nose at him. She laughed. “Ha! Where in the feathers do you get that crazy idea?” she asked. He glanced at Marten. 
The large man blinked and blinked. “He thinks he is the Lightshy Crow.” Marten said.
Margretta’s eyes turned icy. They sent a cold wave over Tomrin’s skin. “You the Lightshy Crow? Please, Master Watersipper. You start a fire or two and suddenly you think you are living out some legend? Look around you! Do you see palaces and parades? What glory do you have here? Your kingdom of desert and dirt? Bow down to you, Master Watersipper? Or will a curtsy do?” The woman curtsied and swore. “Black feathered crows preserve me.” 
“I...I just thought…” Tomrin said. He lowered his walking stick. 
Margretta didn’t have to continue, but she did anyway. “You just thought what? Because you are slightly more precocious than most men, you have to be the Lightshy Crow?” 
“No,” Tomrin said. “I mean yes. I am the only one—” 
“Really? Is that what you think? That you are the only fool man who can dance with a drop of sunfire rushing through his veins?”
“Aren’t I?” 
Margretta scoffed. “You are hardly the only one, but you are the most foolish I know. Feathered foolish thinking me bowing to you. You drinking the ambrosia without training, and without wards? What were you thinking? Nothing comes easy. You should know that.”
“We need to hurry,” Marten said. “The recriminations can wait until after we are safely out of this field. Unless we want this battle? I remind you, this is not good ground.” 
“You’re right, Marten,” Margretta said. “Enough of this foolishness. Now let me ward you.” She stepped forward and touched Tomrin on his shoulder where his neck poked from his brother’s night shirt. “Don’t do anything, don’t talk, don’t distract me. Just hold still.”
Tomrin found the nearness of her in itself distracting. Her touch was cold and her fingers were clammy. But he didn’t shy away. He needed to disappear from those who could see him in the Wellspring. He bet he could learn how to cast the ward faster than Margretta said it took to learn. I am more than slightly more precocious than most men.
The ambrosia around Margretta didn’t seem to stir anymore than the storm already churned, yet tendrils of willvane entered her. The fibers were different, just like the ones that came into him were different when he drank the four ambrosia. For her, it was only willvane which entered her. The fire and ice, and the shadow stayed put, a trick Tomrin still needed to learn. “Only willvane?” he said. “How do you do it?” 
“What?” she asked, distracted. “I can only do one at a time, just as you can only do all four. Now, hush.” Tomrin thought he remembered reading that.
Her willvane snaked into him. It entered him from her fingertips. Then like a growing cocoon, the tendrils filled him. It felt like nothing, but Margretta seemed to wrestle with the fibers, moving her body as she struggled to weave the ward. Sweat beaded on her forehead and she blinked the drops from her eyes when the sweat ran. Tomrin tried to follow the twists and turns but they were like nothing he had done to control the ice and shadow. His net had been as simple as a spider’s web. Margretta’s ward was an incongruous network of contradictions. It seemed at any moment it would come flying apart and unravel like a basket full of yarn tossed over a barn.
She stopped pulling in the willvane, but continued casting. The last tendrils of willvane she tied off and finally all of the ambrosia slipped from her into Tomrin. The ambrosia around him shifted. The storm around him subsided. 
Margretta stepped back wiping her hands on her dress before she wiped her forehead of sweat with the back of her forearm. The look she gave Tomrin was curious.
“That’s it?” Tomrin asked. “It worked right?” 
“Yes, it worked. It’s just—” 
“What?” Tomrin asked. 
“That was harder than it should have been.” 
“What does that mean?” 
“It means,” Marten said, answering for her. “We should leave now. The ward is stable—isn’t it? 
“Yes, yes,” Margretta said, shaking her head. “Marten, take us out of here.” 
“Mount up. We have some riding ahead of us,” the Orish man said. 
“Where are we going?” Tomrin asked. 
“Where we have to. To start with, the way you were going—” Marten pointed. “—that is until I can find a place to double back. We might be invisible in the Wellspring, but horses still leave tracks, and they are visible in this world.” 
“As long as we make it back to Menad in time to fight Rennly. Today is the last day to save Godly Glassworks.”
“You are being chased by censors,” Margreta said, sounding exasperated. “And how many Daughters? You don’t even know. And you are worried about that glass shop?” 
“Margretta please. You too Master Tomrin. We cannot afford to stand here wasting time. All I can do is promise I will try, but our safety is my top priority. The more time we waste, the worse the chances any of us will return to Menad intact.”
“You have obligations,” Tomrin said. “I get that. I have obligations too.”
“And we respect that, Master Tomrin. We all have obligations. Mine is to see us safely out of here… If I can.” 
“Let’s go,” Margretta said. She turned and headed for her bay, snagging her riding gloves from Marten on the way. 
Tomrin turned to his horse. “Sorry old boy, but we ride again.” 
“You really know how to pick them,” Marten said, laughing as he mounted his charger.
“I know,” said Tomrin. “He’s the fastest horse this side of Corundum. I don’t even know his name, but I think I’m going to call him Lightning.” 
Marten chuckled. “Let’s hope he still has some thunder left in him.”
The man led the way, straight towards the nearest peak of the Emerald Mountain. They soon left the current field and came to another, then to a road after the third wide open field. Marten chose north. At a side road they turned east and then doubled back making a circuit but continuing on west until they hit trees. 
After making another circuit and a double back, Marten announced they were heading back to Menad. A road leading south, the old south road, entered Menad from the north, but when they neared Menad, they made another turn, this time back to the east and Tomrin realized where they were. They were just north of the Eastern Highway. 
Marten called a stop. “We’ll walk from here.”
“I need to get rid of Lightning?” 
“Yes. Can’t enter Menad on a stolen horse.” 
Tomrin poured out a taster of water from Maten’s canteen for Lightning. It was a lonely stretch of land ahead and with no water. Then slapping him, he chased him off. “Find your way home!”
With the sun in their eyes they walked into Menad. Marten chatted easily and Tomrin learned the name of both his and Margretta’s horses—King’s Gamble and Queen’s Answer. “It’s good to be home,” Tomrin said when he finally glimpsed the Winged Helm Inn.
“Don’t get too comfortable,” Margretta said. “This may have been your home, but not any more.” 
“Why not? You still expect me to leave?” 
“Master Tomrin, I swear. You think everything can just go back to the way it was?” Margretta was shaking her head at him. 
“Why can’t it?” 
“Probably because it can’t,” Marten said. “And we shouldn’t be discussing this out here.”
They neared the Winged Helm Inn. Tomrin wanted to go inside and drink tarsk until he couldn’t remember his own name.
“I’ll take the horses,” Marten said. “And meet you inside.” 
“This is where you are staying?” Tomrin asked Margretta. 
“Yes. Why?” 
“Nevermind,” Tomrin said. He was tired of walking and tired of running. He hoped he might be able to snag that shell of tarsk if luck turned her eyes his way.
“Will you be coming?” Margretta asked Marten.
“I will see you safe to—to where you are going.”
“And where is that?” Tomrin asked. It felt like they had planned everything without him. 
“Inside,” Margretta replied. “I will see to Queeny myself,” she said to Marten. To Tomrin she added: “Room 204. Go there after I do.” 
At the front door, Tomrin nodded to the door man, forgetting his name. Without Robles the man was simple and efficient. Tomrin hurried inside. The Orioles censors had moved on, as had the slavers. Soon the evening crowd would be heading in. When the man behind the bar asked him what he wanted to drink, Tomrin said, “High spirit tarsk.” Remembering he had no money, he added, “Never mind. I forgot my money in my other pants.” The lie came easy to his lips. “I’m waiting for a friend.” 
“How about a low spirit? On the Helm,” the man said. “You look like you were chased by the Lighshy Crow himself. Waiting for Robles?” 
Tomrin placed his elbow on the bar and ran his hands through his hair. “Thank you, I sure could. Ah, Yes.” 
The man filled a mug and Tomrin sipped it. Robles was in town. Tomrin  wondered what would happen if he came through the door. You won’t believe it. I was the Lightshy Crow. Then I wasn’t. Now I’m waiting for a False Daughter to take me away, or she’ll kill me. Good fun? How about you? Robles wouldn’t believe a word of it. 
The evening crowd slowly filtered in. Tomrin watched for people he knew, like Non and Robles, but it was Margretta, followed by Marten who finally entered. Tomrin emptied his mug and waited a minute to follow, then he stood up and walked around the dais to the hallway. The stairs climbed to the top hallway built into the hillside. The free tarsk twisted in his stomach all the way up the stairs and down the hall. Here the gloom of the lower wall replaced the golden sun peeking through the skylights. Even though his walking stick had left a sound trail of wump on the floor to the room, Tomrin knocked soundly on door 204.
Marten opened the door and Tomrin entered. The man smiled and Tomrin was surprised he was so at ease. The Orish counselor didn’t even glance at his stick; his own long triangle weapon was seemingly forgotten at his hip. 
Margretta sat at the table, the room’s only furniture save for the bed and dresser and an empty chair opposite her. She closed a small black book the size of a billfold, then set it aside. “Sit,” she said, the way a queen might command her court. 
Tomrin hesitated. Sitting would disarm him. “Regardless of the price,” he said. “I am leaving here in a few minutes and heading for the temple.”
“Tomrin Watersipper. Sit,” she said stiffly.
Tomrin walked over to the chair. It was leather padded with a slatted back. He laid his walking stick along the top slat. “I prefer to stand,” he said, laying a hand on the gnarled stick. 
“No, you intend to be difficult,” Margretta said as Marten rummaged, filling up packs in a hurried way. Margretta glanced at the strange man. Big but agile, smart but deadly, he seemed a strange mix of contradictions. The man was on a mission to see Margretta out of the door. 
“Not difficult,” Tomrin said. “But precise as any lawyer. I do not want to leave Menad.” Margretta made to speak, but he plowed over her. “I need to go to the temple before dark and meet my obligation as Founder of Godly Glassworks.”
“You think life can continue as it was?” Margretta said, standing. 
Marten buckled the straps on a large saddlebag. “I told you he might be difficult on this point,” the big man said without looking up.
Margretta sniffed at him and continued. “We have to leave and start your training.” 
“If you need to leave then leave,” Tomrin said. “But I want to stay. I will not let you push me around. I was already pushed into something this week which I regret. It can’t be helped now. Marten knows, he was there.” 
“Yes? Marten, what is this?” Margretta asked.
Marten looked up from a pack he was stuffing with clothes. “Boys, they like to gamble. It is our blood. Can’t you see he is gambling now? He’s betting you aren’t going to kill him here and now. I told you he would likely be difficult with this glass stuff in some way.”
Margretta sighed. “And no little help from you.” She walked around the table and put a hand on Tomrin’s walking stick. She was so close to Tomrin, it made him feel self conscious just standing there. “So you want to stay, but the thing is, I have to go. I can’t be tied down here.” 
“Then go.” 
“But I can’t leave you here unattended.” 
“Why not?” Tomrin asked. With her hand on the stick he knew he could not use it fast enough. 
“You need to be warded.” 
“But you warded me.” 
“Yes, and every few days or so you need to be warded again,” Margretta said. “Did you think it lasts forever?” 
“Well— I— Ah,” Tomrin said. 
Margretta took her hand from the stick and walked back around the table. “Now, sit,” she said. She sat cross-armed herself. 
Tomrin didn’t move but considered if she was lying. He didn’t know. If he sat his power was diminished. His mind churned as he picked up the stick with one hand. He pulled out the chair. “I will hear you out, then you will hear me out,” he said and sat down.
“There are rules.” Margretta began. Marten carried two packs out the door, and shut it.
“Rules?” Tomrin demanded. “There is no time for all that. Listen to me, Lady Margretta, I can agree I need to go with you, to learn to ward myself. But first...I am going to stand up and walk out of here. I am going to go down to the temple one last time. My brother and I have unfinished business we need to transact.” 
“What business could be so feathered important?” Margretta said, slapping the table. 
“I am a Founder of Godly Glassworks,” Tomrin said. “You think I want to go and fight my half-brother? No. I have been avoiding fighting him since I was a child. But he’s found a way to force me to fight, and I’m not going to disappoint him.”
“I don’t understand,” Margretta said, shaking her head.
“I have to beat him at staves to complete the terms of our contract. Marten didn’t tell you?” Tomrin stood and began walking to the door.
“It seemed unimportant at the time.” Margretta said. “Same as now.”
“Not to me,” Tomrin said, turning back to her.
“Is this about money?” Margretta demanded. “Are you worried about gold?”
“Gold? This is about lives and livelihoods. I have to save the shop not just for me, but for everyone who depends on it.” He turned back to the door.
Margretta called after him. “Then what, Tomrin Watersipper?”
Tomrin glanced back at her. “Then I will do what it takes,” he said. “As I always have.” He popped the latch and left the room, leaving the tall handsome woman sitting at her table. 
“We leave tonight!” she called out after him.
Tomrin didn’t answer, his walking stick held his reply. It went wump, wump back down the hall.🔖


Chapter 27: The Temple
	He will burn their temples down,
	To the dry and sodden ground.
		—From The Dark Verses

Tomrin carried the walking stick up Smithy Lane. He moved at a good clip. One last thing remained before he headed to the temple to face Rennly. He needed to talk to Robles. The hour was late, but he might catch him still at work—though now it seemed less likely his friend would still be there. There was no furnace smoke. But with the company newly reformed, there was no doubt much work remained for his friend to do as Pack Leader. Robles will be there, Tomrin told himself as he marched along. He was cutting it close now, with maybe an hour left before the contract’s sunset clause was invoked.
At the silversmiths, Tomrin could see the interior of Godly Glassworks stood dark; the glass Seasargus in the window had never flown darker, and the gray tree on the door never seemed grayer. Tomrin hurried up the walkway. The door was locked and he shuffled around the rocks looking for the key before finally heading through the dusty alleyway for the back door. It too was locked, but someone had not closed it properly as happened from time to time. Popping the handle, Tomrin opened the door to the back room. 
Inside he headed to the front. Things were working out. Though someone had left the mid door open. Up front, Tomrin didn’t stop by his old workstation, but headed straight to Master Laz’s office. He needed paper and a pen to write a note for Robles. Paper he found on the desk, but the inkwell was dry. A graphite rod used for making the smallest glass stamps worked just as well. He pulled one from Master Laz’s middle desk drawer and began to write. 
Robles,
I am leaving Menad and the glassworks. I know I will lose my share but I am fine with that. I wanted to see you in person, but you weren’t here. I am going to the temple to fight Rennly as per our contract. Don’t worry, I will beat him.
Your friend, Tomrin.
P.S. The back door was not properly latched. You have to raise it.
He folded the paper and put a TO THE PACK LEADER on it. Setting the graphite rod on top of it, he stood and left the office. Back outside the glasswork, he closed the door, lifting the handle to secure the latch. Snick.
The sun had climbed perilously low on the horizon now, and Tomrin hurried back towards the Winged Helm Inn. When he turned down the main road, the setting sun filled the west with glare. He looked out of place wearing his brother’s nightshirt but there was no hope for that now. 
Finally downtown, the shadow of the temple’s spire stretched out over the houses and road. The tower’s wooden heights scraped the sky. Tomrin passed the courthouse and circled up the stony walkway outside. In the quiet shadow of the spire, his walking stick clunked loudly against the pavers. He glanced up at the high balconies where a Serath might land. He understood them better now. Up there they were safer, far away from the likes of him.
The temple’s main wooden doors were carved from oak and locked. Tomrin frowned at them. Curious. The temple doors were never locked save for on special occasions—or when a new Daughter had been found. He wondered if they had been closed because of him. But I’ve not been caught. A new Daughter rarely appeared. Not as rare as a male, but still rare. Then again, few liked to admit that one of their own required Purification.
Tomrin pushed through the dead shrubbery and headed for the side doors the cantors, censors, and Daughters used. He tried the set; they were also locked. He knocked with his walking stick. Cong, cong.
“Feathers,” he swore under his breath and continued on to the backdoor. On the west side, the backdoor was locked like the others. Cong. Cong. Cong. No one came running. He thought about going to the south door but began smacking the door with his walking stick. Konk, konk, konk! Konk, konk, konk! 
“What’s going on down there?” an angry voice called out from above. It sounded like Rennly.
Tomrin backed away from the door and looked up. His step-brother bent out a window looking down at him. The low sun struck his brother’s forehead and threatened his eyes. 
Tomrin raised his voice. “It’s time for our bout,” he said.
“No,” Rennly called down. “You’re too late.” 
“The sun still shines. That’s what the contract says,” Tomrin said. 
“That’s not what I mean. I can’t now. Look,” Rennly said. “Come back next week. You had to show up earlier.” 
“Next week? I pick the night!” Tomrin said. “Me.” 
“But, I can’t now. I’m the only one here,” Rennly said, he said something else, but much more quietly. It sounded like he was saying something like even the vault was unguarded. 
“Then you forfeit,” Tomrin said. “The letter of our contract is fulfilled. Ah ha! I have bested you and you know it.”
“Not fulfilled!” Rennly snarled, slapping at something behind him. “It is not fulfilled,” he said, turning back to Tomrin. “Not without a fight.”
“Right,” Tomrin said. “If you don’t face me, I win. Check the words in the contract. If I walk away now I will say I beat you. No one will question it. You say come back tomorrow, but what are we? You think we are brothers in the eyes of the contract? No. You forfeit. I will claim I beat you, because after training I was so much better than you I was able to best you without even harming a single hair on your head, only your feathered pride. That is the intent, Rennly! That is the intent!”
“Not the intent,” Rennly whined. “The intent was to have our little bouts.” 
“Why do you think I changed the words? So I control the when. I am the master of the when! Fight me now or you forfeit!”
Luck was finally playing to his favor and Tomrin savored the look on Rennly’s face. Finally his half-brother was getting a little of his own back. “Stay there,” Rennly shouted. “There is no forfeit!” His head retreated back through the window.. The glass and curtains closed.
The tawny colored lawn would serve well for their ring. It seemed—for all their powers—the gods still refused to control the weather, or the lives of men, despite how they tried. 
Tomrin felt nothing but the bump of dirt as he scratched out a ring. No anticipation, no rush, just the same washed out emptiness as when he’d exited the well earlier that morning. When he finished, he stood in the circle, his back to the sun, his body casting a naked shadow on the temple’s backdoor. 
The door opened. Rennly appeared. He did not have his staff. “Get in here,” he said, impatiently, maybe even a little afraid. His eyes darted.
“I made a ring out here,” Tomrin said. “Did you bring your staff?”
 “I’m not supposed to leave her.” 
“Her?” Tomrin said.  He did not want to go inside. He had not stepped inside the Menad temple in years for other reasons. He didn’t like the idea of being trapped inside with Rennly now.
“We found her today. Terrible timing,” Rennly said. “Now get inside. I can’t leave her for a minute.”  Rennly held the door open.
Tomrin stepped from the ring. “I see no reason we can’t fight inside,” he said as he stepped through the doorway. He hoped he judged Rennly incorrectly. Maybe he wasn’t a rabid animal needing put down. 
His half-brother closed the door and it took a second for Tomrin’s eyes to adjust to the dim lamplight. “You thought my baton, against you with that stick?” Rennly said. “And you aren’t even going to probe if I’m trying to kill you?”
“What about this stick?” Tomrin replied. “And are you going to kill me?”
“Nothing about the stick,” Rennly said and locked the door. “But you won’t believe the day I’m having—because of you. So it would make sense if I was angry enough.”
“Because of me?” Tomrin said. “Nice you feel the need to sugar coat it.”
“You and your late tail feathers. You had to wait until the last feathered minute, didn’t you?”
“That was the deal,” Tomrin reminded him. “I set the time,” 
Rennly scoffed. “This way.” He led Tomrin through the corridor in the back of the temple where the walls hung with tapestries. Alcoves held painted statues Seasargus and lamps made of beaten gold. The hallway was tall and wide enough for a Serath to walk. “What did you do today that you finally came here with a dirty shirt and a cripples’ stick?” Rennly said.
“Umm,” Tomrin said. “I’ve been busy.”
“You think you’ve been busy? We found a new Daughter, but not only that. A man, think of it! Apparently he’s burning up the countryside. Someone else is going to catch him because of you.  Can you believe it? It is like he thinks he is the Lightshy Crow or something.” Rennly stopped at a door. Then turning a key, he entered into a rampway which led up as it wound around the inside the temple’s spire. “Because of you, I stayed back when everyone else left.” They reached a set of doors but kept walking.
“I thought you were afraid of the Corvine Man,” Tomrin said. 
With his baton Rennly tapped each door they came to. “This man is hardly the Lightshy Crow,” he said. “The Lightshy Crow is a fairy-tale your mother told us to scare us.” 
“What about the crazy woman in the mountain?” Tomrin asked. 
“That was just a story I told to scare you,” Rennly said. “You should have seen your face. I thought you were going to swallow your tongue. We tell the same story to all the new recruits.” 
His half-brother chatted easily, and when he was like this, Tomrin could imagine enjoying being around him, but he feared it would not last. The dark streak and no answer to his question of wanting to kill him left an edge of suspicion in Tomrin’s mind.
“You know we don’t need to fight,” Tomrin said after a moment of quiet, only broken by the cluck, cluck of his walking stick striking the ramp. 
“Turning coward now?” Rennly taunted. 
“It’s not that,” Tomrin said. “We both want the glass shop to succeed, don’t we?”
“You think I am going to accept a draw?”
Tomrin grew frustrated. “You think beating me will change anything?” 
“Yes. It will make me feel better. Stop here,” Rennly said at a small door. He  inserted a key and turned the handle. “Wait for me.” He bowed to enter. “I need to check on her.” 
The door closed but did not latch. A slurred voice, that of a woman’s, commanded drunkenly: “Get out!” So lucky as to be cursed with the gift, whoever this woman was, she clearly didn’t find Rennly charming. After a minute, the door opened and Rennly slipped out, straightening his hair. He shut the door as a bit of fabric from inside slipped between the door and the jamb.
Rennly’s face grew calm. A smile formed on it, almost as if painted on. The mask covered up an inner rage. His eyes, however, never changed. “Let’s get on with this,” he said.
“Who was that?” Tomrin asked. 
“Don’t concern yourself with her,” Rennly said. “She’s still impure, but the gods will see to cleansing her spirit of its infernal taint. Now, I think we have a contract to fulfill.” A line of blood on Rennly’s neck formed a rill. He’d been scratched. “Come,” he added, rubbing the scratch.
The ramp came to a flat area outside with the top covered with a heavy red fabric. They reached the balcony level. Shooting up through the decking, pillars of wood held up the roof. The whole level was made of carved wood. The pillars, the walls, even the ladder leading up, had been worked by a carpenter’s chisel. Tomrin thought he recognized the work. This was perhaps some of his father’s earliest carvings. Only the floor and one item on it remained untouched. The item was gray wood twisted to look like some contraption.
“The temple’s perch?” 
“We will stay away from it,” Rennly said. “We’ll have our match here under the red carpet. We’ll not likely have this chance again.”
“True,” Tommrin said. “Our first rematch will be our last.” 
“So confident you can beat me?” Rennly said, opening one of the carved panels to reveal a small closet with staves.
“The thing is, Rennly,” Tomrin said. “I have adjusted for you. I am prepared to take a hit if that is what it takes.”
 The sun streamed in and across the temple from the western balcony. Rennly made a face and frowned. “I’m sure we can see about that,” he said as he grabbed a pair of staves. He tried to hand one to Tomrin. 
“I brought my own staff,” Tomrin said, brandishing his myrrh walking stick. 
Rennly scoffed. “That piece of junk?” He dropped the second staff and kicked it back towards the ramp. “Of course you were serious,” he muttered.
“I don’t know how much more serious I could be,” Tomrin said as he stepped back and took up a stance. “It’s already come in handy twice today.”
Rennly raised an eyebrow. “Really?” He asked. His Orioles spots made him look like an animal of some kind.
Tomrin nodded. “Win or lose, I’m leaving Menad.”
Rennly grinned. “You think you can just disappear now?” His grin turned to a snarl as he assumed a fighting stance.
“Not because of you,” Tomrin replied. “But since I can’t make you see reason, let’s begin.” He shifted his weight, pretending to glance towards the light of the setting sun. “But before we do, you should know that even if you do win, it will change nothing between you and me—I am leaving either way.” 
Rennly pointed to his golden feather badge. “You can’t leave without my say-so.”
Tomrin stared into Rennly’s green eyes. He saw his brother more clearly now. “You stole Gaz away from me simply because he was my friend?” Tomrin said. He hobbled with his stick as he play-danced to give himself better striking room.
“Friend?” Rennly scoffed. “You don’t know anything do you?”
Tomrin saluted with his walking stick. “I know so little it hurts sometimes,” he said. “It really does.” 
Rennly did not return the salute. He attacked, swinging his staff. Tomrin parried. Clatch. He countered with his stick. It was shorter but he could strike like an asp with it. It struck Rennly on the shoulder and his step-brother grunted. “You’re fast,” he said. “But I am stronger.” 
“You are only going to wear yourself out,” Tomrin said.
“I’m not fat like you.” Rennly swung down with his staff. 
Tomrin danced out of its way. His walking stick struck Rennly in the chest, a tap with the tip of the haft, his second point. 
“Fat? Can’t you see it, Rennly?” Tomrin asked.
Rennly extracted his staff. “See what?”
“If that is all the better you have, you should forfeit now,” Tomrin said and feinted. “We’re not children anymore.”
 Rennly fell for the move and swung high to block, looking to make a counter. Tomrin ducked under the swing and with the crook of his stick snagged Rennly leg. His unblocked swing had overbalanced him. Now his front leg held all his weight. Tomrin tugged sharply with his walking stick, toppling Rennly to the deck. Whump. 
“Maybe,” Rennly said as he scrambled back to his feet. “But it seems we still play dirty.”
“Dirty?” Tomrin laughed. “I think that still counts as the third point.” 
Rennly jabbed with his staff. Using his stick, Tomrin pushed Rennly’s staff to the side and struck an easy fourth point, then struck a fifth when Rennly feinted and he counter-feinted pretending to attempt his own counter. Instead he blocked Rennly low swipe then struck Rennly’s forward leg, scoring another grunt. Tomrin let Rennly rub his leg.
“Maybe you have some finesse,” Rennly said as he balanced his staff on his open palms. “More than me, but I have the power.”
“Finess always beats power,” Tomrin said.
“We shall see about that.”
Rennly’s next few swings lost all elegance, lost all veneer of skill or refinement. Clack! Clack! Clack! The blows sent vibrations and numbness into Tomrin’s hands and he feared his stick would break from the blows as Rennly’s own had. “It’s like you are trying to hammer in nails with a sledge. This is supposed to be a civilized fight or not?” Tomrin asked his brother.
“I’m not the one who grew up with animals,” Rennly said as he took a breath and paused his wild attacks. 
During them Tomrin had only been able to score a single additional point, his sixth. He was beginning to tire now. He hoped Rennly was too, but he doubted his step-brother had woken up exhausted. Running across the fields and walking the miles out of the Lower Steppes had drained him. He spoke now to gain a second’s more breath. “You have yet to score a single point, and I only need four to win, to turn you into a skunk.”
“Skunk me? That must be a pleasant thought for you,” Rennly said. “Pleasant indeed.”
Tomrin feinted, whirled, and struck him again. Rennly’s own swing came low, aimed at Tomrin’s right leg.  Rennly had let the previous point through on purpose, a trade. “Ah-hah!” Tomrin groaned.
“That is going to leave a bruise.” Rennly grinned.
Not holding back his own crooked staff, Tomrin scored the next two points. The myrrh rod struck like a whip. When Rennly tried to repeat his trick from the festival, Tomrin was ready for it. After his counter, he popped Rennly low in the ankle. 
“You learn fast,” Rennly said. “But will that be enough?”
“I hope so.” 
“And yet you are getting slower,” Rennly said. “I’m not even breaking a sweat.” It was true. Sweat welled out of Tomrin. It burned his chest where it soaked his wound. “And while you’ve been practicing, do you think I have been off goofing about?” Rennly asked. He changed styles, his stance looser now, not meant for raw power. His staff was like a chameleon’s tongue striking at flies. Clack, clack. Clack, clack. Tomrin fell back from the swift barrage. 
Rennly’s staff was inherently longer and he had a newfound speed. For a second Tomrin worried he might win. Circling, they moved, spiraling outwards. Sweat ran from his forehead, yet he dared not brush it away. He had no time. He dared not even blink. The clack of staves continued as they circled. Rennly swatted at him. I just need to bide my time. The sun was low enough to stab Rennly in the eye. I just need a second. A heartbeat of distraction would be all it would offer. Tomrin committed to taking advantage of it. It was dirty, but he had come to win, and Rennly didn’t seem to tire even as he swung again and again. High, low, it didn’t matter; his step-brother was in far better shape. 
It seemed like forever, like the sun would set first, but finally Rennly squinted. Tomrin’s feint trafficked through the air, stabbing at him, a trick to disjar Rennly from his barrage of snappy attacks. 
Rennly jerked his head. Tomrin shifted on his feet. He rapped his step-brother on his shoulder. “Seven, one,” Tomrin said.
“The sun was in my eye,” Rennly squawked. “That’s the only reason.”.
“Oh, was it?” Tomrin asked as he blocked a jarring blow. “That’s part of the game,” he added. Part of the game—same as Rennly’s shifting style was part of the game. His brother was back to power. Tomrin scored another hit, but pulled the strike. Control was important. He didn’t want to feel the massive strike Rennly’s blows promised if he lost it. “Just three more now,” Tomrin said, removing sweat from his brow, taking advantage of a quick lull.
The sun set. Dusk offered an advantage. Rennly wasn’t even trying to win anymore. He was just going through the motions. With a quick jab, after blocking one of his wild swings, Tomrin tipped the score, nine to one. 
“It’s too bad this is our final bout,” Rennly said as their eyes finally adjusted. “I just don’t want it to end.” 
The twilight seemed to drag for hours, but Tomrin landed the penultimate strike. Ten-one. A feeling of floating washed over him. He was about to win. He could taste it. Winning would mean this charade of a fight would be over. 
“It’s been a good fight,” Tomrin said magnanimously. “Invigorating,” he added, as exhaustion tugged at his arms and legs. “After today I am going to sleep for a week, and if I never wake up again I will be happy. At last we both can live free of whatever it is between us. We can live as our own men, not as Dable Watersipper’s misbegotten sons.”
“Rousing speech,” Rennly said and lashed out.
Tomrin caught his staff with his stick and locked it. “See the reason for my confidence?”
“Are you trying to patronize me?” Rennly said, pulling back. Their weapons unlocked. He whirled and swung madly. Tomrin ducked. Swoosh. 
“Not at all,” Tomrin said. “I am just saying it will be nice, once things go back to normal.” 
“Normal?” Rennly said. Clack, clack. 
“Yes,” Tomrin said. “Life under the contract gives you plenty of the glasswork’s profits.” 
The twilight faded and their weapons became silhouettes. “Sure,” Rennly said. He made a similar move to one in their bout at the fair.
Tomrin pretended to be taken in by it but dropped to his knees. He swung his walking stick across Rennly’s thigh. Fap. Eleven, one. He breached the ten point spread. “Now, I must go.”
“And where do you have to be off to so feathered fast?” Rennly asked. “In such a rush?”
“Here it comes,” Tomrin muttered to himself. “Places,” he said, resting his body on his staff. He could hardly say he needed to catch up with Margretta and Marten so they could run off because he had the Leviathan’s Mark on his chest. 
“What places?”
“New places. Menad is no longer for me.”🔖


Chapter 28: The Horror of Fire
If the gods are so powerful, why have they not found me yet?
—Words scrawled in the margins of Cologon’s Living Book of the Dead

Thought ceased and Tomrin moved by reflex. His muscles tensed themselves and his fingers squeezed around his walking stick as he moved it up to block Rennly’s staff. His wrists were at a poor angle to stop Rennly’s staff as it slid through the air. It was a gray form barely visible. Cathawuck! The walking stick blocked the staff but not completely, not enough to stall it before striking Tomrin across the left cheek and ear. 
White points of jagged light filled his vision. “Feathers,” he swore and his instincts took over as his ears buzzed and his cheek burned as if stabbed with red hot glass where Rennly’s staff hit him.
Suddenly, Tomrin found himself on his feet, pushing his walking stick so as to catch another of Rennly’s swings. “So this is you after all?” 
“Yes, this is me,” Rennly spat. 
He began raining down towering blows, pushing Tomrin back. The vibrations of the walking stick rattled all the way down his arms up to his teeth. In the darkness each wild swing was a potential break or fracture. He feared his walking stick couldn’t hold up much longer. The world, more particularly Rennly, had gone mad. 
“Stop this Rennly! Relent and I will let you live!” Tomrin shouted as he began to circle. Clack. Clack. He focused on parrying. He couldn’t see for a tinker’s tailfeathers. The balcony, he thought, and fell back under Rennly’s blows, dragging Rennly with him. 
“Let me live?” Rennly laughed. “If this has to be our last fight,” he said as he swung. “Let’s make it a good one!” 
“You aren’t even listening to me!” Tomrin shouted at him. “You’ve had your chance for a good fight.” He backed out onto the balcony, into the starlight. “Cross me now and you risk death.”
Rennly followed Tomrin out onto the balcony. “Death? Then I bet now you wished you had availed yourself of the staff I offered you?” he said. Behind Rennly, Tomrin could see the perch. It seemed for a second that his brother had sat up on it, and that he dismounted it as he stepped onto the balcony. “Your problem is,” Rennly continued. “You think you are the best at everything.” Tomrin held his tongue as they circled. Rennly swung again and again like a lunatic, crashing his staff against Tomrin’s walking stick, trying to break it. “That’s what it is!” Rennly said. “Everything comes too easy for you Peregrine.”
“Easy?” Tomrin asked, surprised by this verbal attack. “I worked hard to become good at glass. What have you done? Martial training? And yet you can’t even beat me at a child’s game of sticks.”
“Easy for you, a Peregrine slave boy with no responsibilities.”
“I’m here aren’t I,” Tomrin growled.
“Look at you! Always judging. It’s easy for you to look good. As a Peregrine half-breed no one expects anything of you. You dress yourself, you show up to work, and do half a day’s work, then go home and people sing your praises. I have to work for everything I have! Everyone expects more from me!”
A swing went through and struck Tomrin in the belly, but he had tensed. He swung his stick. It hit Rennly’s face. The blow stunned his half-brother, and Rennly blinked in confusion. 
“You are envious of me,” Tomrin said. “Aren’t you?”
“What?” Rennly demanded. “No, I am not.”
“If you could see your face right there as I struck you, you would know you should stop,” Tomrin said. “We’ve both had our fun—we’ve each had our say. But I am done playing. I must go.”
Rennly lunged.
Tomrin side stepped but his foot caught on the railing as he tried to move. Rennly, plowed into him, his staff across his body. He pushed the staff and himself onto Tomrin’s chest and onto the crook of the walking stick. He trapped it. A flood of vertigo washed over Tomrin as Rennly pushed him back onto the railing.
“It is a long way down,” Rennly sneered. “When you measure yourself against me, now don’t you think?”
Jerking his head as if to headbutt Rennly, Tomrin looped both his feet around the pillars of the railing. It was the only reason Rennly couldn’t push him completely over, to fall on the sun-baked ground below. “I don’t measure myself against you, Rennly. I don’t even think about you.”
“I think about you all the time!” Rennly roared.
“Why?” Tomrin said. His back was going to break, arched as it was—or the railing would. “It’s been years since you left Woolad.”
Rennly roared. It was some terrible bestial roar of an animal in pain, wild and mindless. As he roared, his muscles shook and Tomrin could feel the raw power in his half-brother coming to the fore, yet behind him what seemed like a phantom appeared. It held the discarded staff.
A young Orioles woman walked out into the moonlight, her naked feet padding drunkenly on the wooden balcony decking. Tomrin felt befuddled. He knew the girl. The judge’s daughter’s light gray dress was slightly ripped. “Elisah,” he breathed her name. She looked wild-eyed, like she had seen a ghost. She half-seemed a ghost herself. Tomrin couldn’t understand. What was she doing here? Of all people—and her looking like this waif?
She screamed and swung the staff. “Yuah!” It was an artless swing but the staff clobbered Rennly on the back of the head. Cluth. The blow stunned him a second.
Tomrin pushed off the railing, and Rennly stumbled backwards. Rennly spun, and with the back of his hand, he slapped Elisah hard across the face. She tumbled and hit her head on the wooden decking.
Free of Rennly’s weight Tomrin swung his walking stick at Rennly while he was turned away, striking him in the neck with the crook. Rennly staggered and dropped his staff. “What the feathers are you doing, man?” Tomrin demanded. “She’s just a girl.” 
Rennly’s hand went to his neck where Tomrin had hit him. It was the same spot where the new Daughter had scratched him. Rennly spoke but Tomrin understood in a flash without needing to hear it from Rennly. Elisah Reydal was the new Daughter. “She’s nothing but an unclean gosling awaiting Transport.”
“She’s a good person,” Tomrin said, stepping forward. Rennly blocked his way. Tomrin raised his walking stick. “Get out of my way, Rennly. I think you killed her.” 
“That would be no great loss. The gods have plenty of Daughters,” Rennly said. “But you aren’t even supposed to be here. Let alone see her.”
“What did you do to her?” Tomrin asked. “She looks afright.” 
“I didn’t don’t do anything,” Rennly said. 
“That’s a lie. Her dress didn’t rip itself!”
“If you must know...” Rennly said, waving his hands. He didn’t complete his sentence but leaped at Tomrin again. He moved so quickly Tomrin didn’t have time to stop him. His left hand grabbed Tomrin by the nape of the shirt and tore his shirt open. Rennly’s eyes went wide. “What the feathers?” Rennly let go and grabbed at the baton at his hip. 
Tomrin swatted his stick at his hand, preemptively blocking Rennly’s attempt to use the device. It clattered away. “Why did you do that?” Tomrin demanded, stupidly glancing at his own chest and wound.
“You!” Rennly shouted, pointing at Tomrin’s chest. His eyes met Tomrin’s. “You! You are him?” 
“Yes, I’m him,” Tomrin said. “Now you see what a fool you are? You can’t kill me. And I don’t want to have to kill you either, Rennly. You can come with me.” 
“Come with you?” Rennly asked. “You came here for the girl?” 
“No, I came for our contract,” Tomrin said. 
Rennly stepped back and eyed the girl. “I need you to drop your staff, right now.” It was as if a sudden bout of sanity had overtaken Rennly’s madness.
 Tomrin laughed. “Me? I’m not going to drop my walking stick now. Not now nor ever. Think, Rennly. Think! How have you been acting? You aren’t thinking straight.” 
“I’m thinking straight now,” Rennly said, swallowing. “I’m interdicting you.” 
“Hear yourself, Rennly,’’ Tomrin said. “I have set fires. I have banished my family to the desert. I have come here through imprisonment and death. Do you think I am going to submit to you? Without even a pleasant please and thank you?”
“Death?” Rennly said, his cold green eyes glancing about warily.
“Yes, and now you have to come with me.” Tomrin pointed to the girl. “With us.”
“Us?” Rennly asked. “Now you are with her?”
“I can’t let you have her. Not now.” 
Rennly reached for his knife.
“Don’t do it, Rennly!” Tomrin pointed his walking stick at his step-brother. “Don’t make me kill you.”
“Kill me?” Rennly said, stopping his hand. “You kill me and you kill Godly Glassworks.” 
“No, it will survive your death. If I kill you, you’ll be dead. Everyone will assume something happened. An accident, perhaps.” 
“They might, sure,” Rennly replied. “Ha! You think I’m foolish, but I remade my will while you were off training. If anything happens to me now, the glass shop will be censored.” 
“No...” 
“Ah! You see it. This is the best! Kill me and you kill your darling glass shop. So now you have to submit to me and undergo Purification.”
Tomrin shook his walking stick at him. The Luster, however, evaded him. Even if he wanted to, he could not make good his threat. “Fine, Rennly, you win,” he said. “And yet...?”
“Of course I win,” Rennly said. “And yes there is a yet. I still have to kill the girl. She has seen too much.”
“What?” 
 Rennly pulled out his knife. He knelt down over Elisah’s sleeping form. Her chest rose and fell with her breathing.
“No!” Tomrin roared as he brought his weapon back up. A fury gripped him—and a deathly calm. He was willing to sacrifice himself for the glass shop, but not her! “Why her?” he demanded.
Rennly glanced up at him. “Think of it as your first step—” Rennly said. “—in your Purification.”
“You would never get away with killing a Daughter.”
“I always get away with everything,” Rennly said. “It’s my charm. And she’s not a Daughter yet.”
“Brother. Rennly. Think,” Tomrin said, his anger returning.
Rennly laughed. “What is that even supposed to mean?”
“You can’t kill her and get away with it.” 
“Of course I can.”
A sinking lightness filled Tomrin’s stomach as the Luster called to him. “You think I killed your father so you want to hurt me?” Tomrin asked. “Is that it?”
Rennly sat back on his heels. He lowered his knife Elisah’s throat. “I don’t think about Davot. I was the one who killed him.”
“What? Why?”
Rennly smiled. “When I learned he wasn’t my real father.”
“You?” Tomrin asked. “I knew you were insane. I told Hadras. Or do you think I am stupid? I have other brothers, or did you forget that?”
“Like Gaz?”
“Gaz?”
“He had our father’s eyes,” Rennly said. “As do all Dable’s children.”
Tomrin saw it clearly. His step-brother was a scorpion. His knife was his stinger and he loomed over Elisah’s body, confident in his prey. He was an animal bent on killing, and killing, and killing. 
Having to stop him, to lower himself to a level of a beast, made Tomrin feel ill. “I think I am going to be sick, Rennly, if you move another inch,” he said. “My parents know what I am. Emy knows. Hadras knows. They know who and what I am. They kept me not as a prisoner, as pious as they are. I left them to the desert, overawed by the fire of my own damnation. Think! You can not kill this girl, not now. Not in my presence. You are my prisoner more than I am yours. I don’t care what righteous gods you serve, I am going now with her. Only one choice remains for you, and that is to go with me. This is your last warning.”
“Warning?” Rennly raised the knife as if to throw.
“Toss the knife off to the side, Rennly,” Tomrin said, his voice cleared of all emotion. The Luster was as nothing. It spoke for the Rennly’s of the world. Tomrin shouted over it. “I will not say it again!” 
Rennly wavered. “What are you saying?” 
Tomrin dissolved and the Corvine Man took over. “I will not found shops or houses.” His words tumble out. “Don’t you see it, brother? Come me!” He reached out his free hand to Rennly. “Join with me now. Live! Cross over into history with me.”
“Join you? Never,” Rennly sneered and arched back his wrist with the knife as he stood. “I will see you dead first! And Seasargus will reward me.” He winged the knife at Tomrin but the Corvine Man was already casting. 
Willvane had already wrapped the shadows and the ice. Those three powers vanished, leaving only sunfire burning through his veins. He cast the fiery ambrosia out, pushing it into the walking stick he pointed with one hand, holding it by a single crook. 
The knife spun through the air as a wicked fire filled the walking stick. Sunfire bloomed in all directions as the firebolt shot down the gnarled length and burst out the butt in a calamitous swirl of orange and gold. The knife glinted and was engulfed in the catastrophic flame. The fire burned and roared like a glassworking torch. Like a fist of swirling death, it punched Rennly in the chest, carrying the knife with it. Frawh! 
The excess fire pounced on him and pushed Rennly backwards. It frothed and splashed on the wooden floor near Elisah. The blade stabbed Rennly’s chest and the fire burned a shocked expression onto his face as the cruel flames lit up his ghastly, dead eyes.
Tomrin tossed the remnants of the flaming stick in his hand aside and rushed to where Rennly teetered over Elisah. Tomrin pushed him backwards to keep him from spreading the flames to the girl.
Ridding himself of the rest of the sunfire, he pushed it into Rennly and into boards under him. With strength of will alone, Tomrin held the fire at bay as he grabbed Elisah by the wrists and dragged her off the balcony into the shadows.
Her hands slipped through his. Tomrin fell to his knees. He was using all his strength to control the sunfire. The farther he was from it, the harder it became. Fire was beginning to leach everywhere. He stared into the Wellspring in horror. He’d torn his ward, but he had no time for that. The fire filled into the wooden decking. It soaked into the wooden planks and crawled up the pillars of the railing. It filled the platform to skitter under him and Elisah. It snaked down into the beams holding up the temple roof. It would burst free and the tower would become an inferno. 
Tomrin pushed his arms under Elisah’s limp form. He picked her up and walked into the darkness as the flames behind crackled. The smell of burning chased them into the shadows which flickered on the wall. 
Heat was in the air; too much ambrosia; and all his control was fading. The sunfire began to run ahead of Tomrin. The dead weight in his arms rolled back her head. The girl looked up at him. “Ahh!” she said.
“Ahh?” Tomrin replied and she rolled her drunken head back over.
Everything was coming apart. By the time he made it to the ramp, the planks ahead were filled with sunfire. As he marched awkwardly down the ramp with her, Elisah opened her eyes and looked at him for a second. Behind him the fire roared. He had maybe two levels left to go. The walls themselves were smoking now and tiny flames came alive as Elisah spoke. “Tomrin Watersipper?” 
“Can you walk,” he asked her, but her head rolled back once again. 
You need to let her go, a voice inside his head said. She was too heavy. His steps were too slow. Like this, they were both going to die. Save yourself! The smoke began to choke his breath. Tomrin had heard this voice before, the first time when he had tried to save Rennly’s father. That time he had obeyed. Now he yelled at it. “No! Not her too!” He stumbled on through the blinding smoke and flames. Not her! Not her! At last he reached the gray stone of the temple proper.
The air was cool here. He let himself drop down to his knees as he laid Elisah out on the flat stones. 
“Not her?” she asked, opening her eyes again. Tomrin realized he was still repeating his mantra.
“Nothing,” he said. “You’re alive.” 
She flopped her arms and let them lie on the stone. She stared at the fire burning in the rafters above them. “My head hurts,” she said.
“But can you walk?” Tomrin asked her. “The place is coming down.” 
“I don’t know,” she said.
Tomrin helped her to her feet and she leaned on him as they moved down the stone ramp to the ground floor. They exited the back of the temple to the front. While the temple was lit by lamps in the back, here only stars and fire shone through the cut glass windows.
“I need a rest,” Elisah said.
Tomrin sat her in the front pews facing the altar. “Stay here,” he said. He hurried to the front door. It was still locked. He pulled the handle, but it was futile. The large door budged not an inch. He hurried back down the aisle. “It’s locked. I’m going to go try the other doors.”
“I’m coming with you,” Elisah said, standing. She wobbled like she had been drinking high spirit tarsk all day. Tomrin put out a hand to catch her. She pulled back and nearly fell. “I’m fine. Let’s go.” 
The fire pulled air in from the cracks like a chimney fire. As soon as they opened any door, the temple would burn and the walls would collapse and fall into the stones to burn like a fire in a pit. Elisah seemed apprehensive at the howl of the wind through the first door. It grew louder as they approached. “It’s just the stove winds,” Tomrin said. 
“I’m not afraid of banshees,” Elisah replied. 
Tomrin thought of Margretta—and her threat to kill him. “Me either,” he said, swallowing. The wind squalled through the crack of the door, but it was locked. Rennly had the key. “Too late now to go back and get the key from my brother.” 
“He’s your brother?” 
“Half-brother,” Tomrin said, “It’s a long story. Don’t worry, I’m nothing like him. He did this?” he added, motioning to her ripped bodice. 
“Maybe we can reminisce later, when we are out of here. I think the temple is about to collapse.” She didn’t look like the girl he’d just saved from death. She seemed more willing to take charge. “All the other doors will be locked. I thought you knew these were open.” 
“Well—ah,” Tomrin stammered. “I had hoped.” 
“Great, so we burn to death?” she said. “Your brother was crazy, setting the temple on fire. Probably the worst censor in history.”
“Actually, I, um...”
“What are you saying?” Elisah said, eyeing him.
“I was the one who set the temple on fire. It was an accident,” he added when she gave him a withering look. 
“Fires this large aren’t accidents,” Elisah said. “Are you an arsonist or something?”
Tomrin reflected on the windbreak he’d burned, on the acres of trees gone in one afternoon. “No,” he replied. “I’m not setting fires for fun.” 
“So you didn’t get his key before you started all this?”
“No. I didn’t”
Elisah frowned. “So now what?”
“Well, I guess—step back.” Tomrin put his hand on the wooden door. He figured this was going to hurt and he would need to be careful. Elisah took a step back. He tried to summon the Luster. He closed his eyes. 
“What are you doing?” she asked him. 
Tomrin squeezed his eyes tightly shut. “Rah!” he growled, but the Luster eluded him. He pulled back from the door. “You try it.” 
“Try it?” Elisah said. “Try what?” 
“Aren’t you a Daughter?” Tomrin asked. “Can’t you see the ambrosia in the Wellspring?” 
“Ambrosia? Well, yes, but no,” Elisah said. “What does that have to do with anything?” 
“Use the sunfire, or ice, I don’t know. It’s easier for a girl.” 
Elisah pulled herself up. “I am a woman.” 
“Just try it,” Tomrin said, not knowing if he should apologize. Talking to her was like standing on an anthill.
She walked to the door. “Sunfire?” 
“Yes,” Tomrin replied. “Just pull it in. You can see it right?” 
“I can’t see anything.” She pulled back from the door. 
“You are a Daughter, aren’t you?” 
“They gave me something. I can’t remember. My mind is fuzzy.” 
“You didn’t even try.” 
“You don’t know me,” Elisah snapped. “Now, you got me killed.” 
“I saved you,” Tomrin said, growing angry. He was afraid now he and she would die right here after all. “Stand back,” he commanded as the Luster gripped him. 
A bit of wood could not stand between him and life and freedom. No, he was the Corvine Man, the bugbear of legend. He was the cloud to blight the sun. He was both the monster and the myth. He was Heaven’s destruction and the end to the Serath Dominion. He drank in a sip of ambrosia from the Wellspring. It was the tiniest of tiniest. I am no feathered arsonist!
The willvane tangled with him like a thing alive, an animal with its back to the wall. He wrestled it as he held his hands to the door. Sunfire burned within him. The glacier ice froze him to the quick, while the darklight rotted all, corroded all! Life! Hope! Love! They were nothing compared to the glory.
He wove the willvane. With it he netted the glacier ice and darklight in its web. The sunfire he saved for last. It threatened to boil him down to a charcoaled corpse. He thrust it into the planks of the door, burning his palms as the fire scorched from him. “Ahh!” he shouted. The pain was a sharp light in his head. He pushed himself away and closed himself off to the ambrosia as the Luster fled. 
“Get back! Get back!” he shouted, running as he held the raw sunfire inside the door. 
“Why?” Eisah demanded as he grabbed her. He pulled her back down the passage. She pulled free of him and turned to stare at the door. It only looked different in the Wellspring. “Nothing is happening,” she said. 
Her words crumbled his control and the door exploded in a rain of flame and wood. Skrootch! Air rushed into the passage and blew bits of flaming char at them. Tomrin shielded his eyes with his arm. The fire was normal, hot, but natural. “We are free,” he said, turning his head to Elisah.
She seemed agast what she saw. “Who are you, Tomrin Watersipper?” she asked, her voice a horrified whisper. 
“I don’t know,” Tomrin whispered just as softly. He turned away from her questioning eyes. “But sometimes,” he added, more to himself than to her. “I fear I could be the crow from my dreams.”🔖


Chapter 29: From Ashes, Creation
He shall pull down the heavens;
For he shall turn day into night.
—From The Dark Verses 

Elisah touched his shoulder. Tomrin turned as she pulled him around to face her fully. Her eyes were not on his face. She stared instead at the scales on his exposed chest, clearly seeing them for the first time. Shock and surprise lit up her face at what she saw. Tiny regrowing scales glinted red. How she had missed the Leviathan’s Mark before was forgivable. The fire above still burned. The stove winds rushed by, bellowing, like bottled air at the glass shop. “We need to get out of here before the dressings fall,” Tomrin said.
Elisah mouthed something like a question, but Tomrin could not hear her over the fire’s quickening roar. The winds were picking up. She put a freezing finger on the ring of the scales. It tickled something fierce. 
He grabbed her arm by the wrist. “We need to run for it!” he yelled. Bits of door were burned sideways from the inrushing wind. “Follow me!” he said, but he didn’t give her any choice; he kept hold of her and dragged her towards the open night. Cool air awaited them outside. 
A dark shape appeared outside. For a second Tomin’s heart raced. Censors. Tomrin recognized the man, however, and the woman who stood with him.
“Tomrin Watersipper,” Marten said.
“Counselor,” Tomrin said as he exited with Elisah in tow. “And Lady Margretta.” The woman wore a sour expression on her face. “I believe you both know the judge’s daughter, Elisah Reydal,” Tomrin added.
“We thought maybe she was the one,” Marten said gravely. He sheathed the black triangular flange of metal he held, sending it to his hip. His black riding cloak he unhooked as he stepped forward. He swung the sable swath over Elisah. “It’s unfortunate to see you again like this, Miss Reydal.” 
“Thank you, Counselor,” Elisah said, wrapping herself like a caterpillar in a cocoon. 
Margretta scowled as she looked Tomrin up and down. She moved to grab his ripped shirt, she held it over his Leviathan’s Mark a moment. “Was this your idea all along, Master Watersipper?” 
“No,” Tomrin replied. Behind him a section of the temple crashed in with a wrenching sound. Glass shattered. “Rennly—things got out of control—he’s dead.” 
“Have you thought about how you look in the Wellspring?” Margretta asked coldly. 
“Yes,” Tomrin replied, looking again but widening his view, not focusing only on the ambrosia churning around him but to the wider world. To the south he saw two lights. They were still quite far away. “Oh?” he said. 
“Two more on top of those already looking for you,” Margretta said. “Now they know you are right here.” She sighed. “But with the feathered temple on fire, they won’t even need to look, now will they?” 
“Counselor Marten? Lady Margretta?” Elisah said. “You’re—” 
“In a hurry?” Margretta snapped. “Now you hold still,” she said to Tomrin. She put her hands on his shoulders. “I could offer further warnings, but, I swear you’ll just do the opposite.” 
“Margretta, we need to go,” Marten said. “Remember, the crowd building out front?” 
“Yes, Marten,” Margretta replied as willvane entered her from the maddened swirl of the four ambrosia in the Darklit Pond. “Now—” She said but didn’t finish her thought but wove the willvane as she had before. The web filled Tomrin. “And hippity-hop goes the horsey’s head…” she muttered to herself.
“What’s she doing?” Eisah asked, but Marten shushed her. “Not now, Recorder Reydal. She needs to concentrate.” 
Finally Margretta completed her spelldance and pulled back. Tomrin could almost feel the will she exerted to wrestle the feathery willvane under control. He himself felt no different, but his footprint in the ambrosia bubbled and disappeared.
“Me with Miss Reydal?” Marten said. “And meet at the horses?” 
“Yes,” Margretta said. She was sweating and she slumped her shoulders as if exhausted from her weaving. “Someone will find out something’s happened here.” 
“The others...?” Marten said.
Margretta raised her eyebrow at the question. “Call no attention to yourselves.” 
“Right,” Marten said. He led Elisah away around the curve of the temple and towards the front. 
“And you remember this,” Margretta said to Tomrin. “You tore your night shirt getting out of bed. Now hold it shut.” 
He did as he was ordered and followed her without prompting. In the front of the temple, the courtyard filled with people. Lookie-loos always came out when there was a fire of any magnitude and he and Margretta seemed no different than any of them. The fire trucks arriving garnered all eyes. Even still, Tomrin found himself holding his breath. He and Rennly had been out fighting on the balcony. Someone could have seen, yet no one stopped him. The fire trucks, however, stopped right in front of him and Margretta. She pushed around them as the firemen jumped down. The fire marshal was with them. 
“Master Watersipper,” Tamerton said. “Will you look at this?” The man pointed disapprovingly at the burning temple. “I don’t know what to make of it.” 
Tomrin stopped. “I know,” he said. To ignore the man would call more attention to himself. The man knew him. “I have no idea how the temple could catch fire.” 
“It’s wood,” the man said. “But here I have less jurisdiction. The Daughters should take care of it. I wonder if they are alright. I feel we need to do something.” 
Tomrin glanced at Margretta. She glared at him as if to say: Let’s go. What are you doing?
Tomrin grimaced and turned back to the Rubish fireman. “Too bad my friend isn’t here. He’d go in. Me though? I think I’ve had my fill of fire,” he said. “I better go. I can’t even bear to see it anymore. I don’t know what I was thinking. I should have just stayed in bed.” 
“Me too,” the Marshall mused. 
“Thing is, Marshall,” Tomrin said. “If the temple is burning it’s because Daughters want it too. I personally wouldn’t get involved.” 
The man frowned. “I suppose you are right,” he said. “Thank you, Master Watersipper.” 
Tomrin walked away. Just how the man was in a position of leadership boggled his mind. He put thoughts of the man aside and followed Margretta to the temple’s courtyard then to the courthouse’s stables. They entered through a side door and met Marten and Elisah already inside. A lamp hanging from the low rafter cast a dull orange glow on them. Elisah looked angry. “I demanded to know what is going on!” she said as soon as Margretta opened the door. 
“Hush!” Margretta said sharply. “We have no time to explain.” She waved a hand at Tomrin and he shut the door. 
“I am a judge’s daughter,” Elisah said. “I know a kidnapping when I see it. I was kidnapped once already today. And Tomrin Watersipper, he can spelldance, I saw it. Who are you people? Don’t tell me you are a Daughter.” 
“Let me make this easy for you, Elisah Reydal. I know very well who you and who your father is. But do you know who I am? I was not born a lady. I had to earn it—which I did by keeping my mouth shut and doing what had to be done, by making the hard choices—choices like the one you are about to make. Trust me and trust this seal.” Margretta pulled a card from her pocket. On it was stamped the image of a peach and some words Tomrin could not read, but he knew the card. “Trust it and live.” Margretta handed it to Elisah.
Elisah read aloud. “The bearer of this bond speaks for me, Lord of the Crystal Throne, Champion of the East, and Emperor of Corundum, Jarvis Teabril. Do as they command and you do as I command. There is a signature.” She squinted at it. 
Margretta snatched the card back and stuffed it into a hidden pocket in her dress. “Yes, that is the emperor’s signature,” she said. “Now are you sworn officer of the court here or not?”
Elisah nodded at Margretta. “I am.”
“Good. Later I can tell you more,” Margretta continued. “But for now, all you need to know is that the emperor needs you to do as I tell you. Or you could choose your second option.” 
“Death?” Elisah asked in a whisper. One of the horses whickered in the silence. “But…”
“Think,” Margretta said and pulled her hand from her pocket. 
A small stone sat in her palm. The ambrosia stirred ever so slightly around Tomrin and he realized it was Margretta channeling sunfire into the stone. It glowed in the Wellspring with a thousand tiny steamers of fiery ambrosia. A ball of flames appeared in the stillness above them, casting light like the noonday sun. “I would make it painless, but you would still be dead.” 
“No,” Tomrin said. “You wouldn’t.” 
Marten put a heavy hand on Tomrin’s shoulder. “You give Mistress Reydal far too little credit, Master Tomrin,” he said. “She is as wise as her father. She will choose correctly.” 
His words hung in a growing silence as the horses in their cramped stalls stood quiet as if they were also waiting. King’s Gamble, the tallest of the three, glanced from person to person as Elisah considered her options. She looked as sober as her judge father, not the stumbling mess from before. She pulled Marten’s black greatcloak closer around herself and said, “I want to live—but under protest. I will bring this to Jarvis himself if I have to.” 
“Good,” Margretta said. “This way you will have that chance.” 
“Then what?”
“We only have three horses,” Marten said. “That means you two will have to share.” He indicated Tomrin and Elisah. 
“I am not a very good horseman,” Tomrin admitted, sheepishly. The idea of sitting close to Elisah now even after carrying her embarrassed him. 
“It’s only until we find another horse,” Margretta said, letting go of the channel. “For now we need to get out of Menad. The place is going to be crawling with—trouble.” Tomrin could hear the brief stutter and was sure Elisah could hear it too. But he dared not say a word. Not in front of Margretta, though he felt Elisah deserved to know what she was getting into. But in truth he wasn’t sure himself. The day had turned into a nightmare. And it wasn’t over yet.
Marten helped Tomrin and Elisah up onto a gray razor called Misty. The riding coat he took back from Elisah. Margretta produced an overshirt for her and Tomrin.
“You two will come after us. Stay close,” Marten said. The Orish man led his massive dun to the stable’s double doors. Opening them, he led out his charger. “Stay Gamble,” he said and then led out Queen’s Answer for Margretta. Then Misty. After which he disappeared back inside the stable door, closing it behind himself.
Margretta made a face but said nothing. Finally the large Orish man joined them from the side door. “Had to get the light.”
“Order, nothing out of place, look natural, “Margretta said to Tomrin and Elisah. “That’s how we stay alive. And not by talking to the fire marshall.” 
“Is that what took you so long?” Marten asked. 
“He knew me. I had to stop.” 
“Then you did right,” Marten said.
Margretta grunted. “Let’s go. We won’t know if it was right until later.”
Marten led the way. His massive dun was impossible to miss. “So much for not looking conspicuous,” Tomrin said, turning his head to speak with Elisah. 
“Just watch where you’re going,” she said, not finding him funny. She had her arms around him and he could feel her pressed against him. He tried to ignore her closeness, but his body responded. Head forward, he made sure he followed closely on Margretta and her bay.
Her animal rushed ahead, a dark gray splotch. They were just three shapes heading west. Then north, then west, then south. 
“Marten is taking us on quite a route,” he said, wondering if the man knew where he was going. If not, he pretended he did. The streets he took were devoid of life. Quiet, empty shops lined them. The man was avoiding the eyes of strangers. Yet there was an eerie feeling to the streets he chose. Maybe it was just Marten’s paranoia leaching into him.
Margretta must have felt it. “What is it, Marten?” she called ahead. The man slowed his mount to a stop. Tomrin nudged Misty close to hear their words as they spoke. 
“….but it’s not a human, it’s an animal.” 
“Why would it be following us?” 
Marten shrugged. “I don’t know wild animals that well.” 
“What’s going on?” Tomrin asked. 
“It’s nothing,” Margretta said, “A dog maybe. It’s probably hungry.” 
The look on Marten’s face said he didn’t believe it was just a dog. He reined his dun about and led them again, continuing his random travel through Menad, heading west by starts. Tomrin kept looking around for a wild dog supposedly shadowing them but he saw nothing, maybe a pair of yellow eyes under a porch which disappeared as soon as he thought he saw them. Seeing things. 
But the night seemed unreal. He was leaving Menad. The glass shop was ruined. And these people he was with, he didn’t know, and certainly couldn’t trust. He thought he could trust Elisah, but everytime he had her figured out, she changed. And Marten—Tomrin wanted to like the man, but now he was seeing things—wild animals in the shadows.
“What is it?” Elisah asked. 
 “What do you mean?” 
 “You’re breathing hard,” Elisah said. “Am I squeezing you too hard?” 
“No, it’s nothing,” Tomrin replied. “I never wanted to leave Menad.” 
“Me either,” Elisah squeezed him with her arms. “I can’t imagine. I’m sure it will be fine, now that we are going to see the emperor.” 
Tomrin made a mollifying sound in his throat. “Yes, but, I don’t think that is where we are going.” 
“I keep forgetting you are not with them,” Elisah said. “Especially after what you said. And what you…are.” 
“I am a good person.” 
“But you killed your brother.” 
“And I’m sorry I did, but he made me do it.” 
“Made you?” Elisah said. “But still, the temple.” She glanced off to their left where it burned. Here and there houses came alive with people looking out over the valley towards the burning temple. 
A woman sobbed at the sight. A man, her husband most likely, held her. Fear gripped the man’s eyes. Talk of the Enfernii demons wasn’t just in whispers. Another man lamented that the gods had abandoned them. When people asked what they knew, Marten replied, “We know only as much as you, my friend.” 
Tomrin was relieved when they finally reached the level and the valley was hidden by the trees. “You wanted to be a judge like your father?” Tomrin asked Elisah. 
“I was spending my free time in the Hall of Victory.” 
“Never saw you there; but I stopped going.” 
“I think I can see the ambrosia now,” she said, suddenly distracted. “Faintly…”
At a break in the trees, Tomrin pulled Misty to a stop. In the dark he could see the glass shop and the Winged Helm Inn in the distance. 
Marten and Margretta returned to him. “Do you see it?” Marten said. 
“It?” asked Elisah. 
“The coyote?” Margretta said.
 “You saw a coyote?” Tomrin asked without looking away from them. 
 “It was large for one, but it wasn’t a wolf or a dog.” 
“It’s probably nothing,” Margretta added. 
“On the lower steppes there are stories of a coyote attacking large animals at night,” Tomrin said. “Eating even horses, cows, and oxen. A folktale to frighten pilgrims and children.” Marten wore a sacrificial knives. It made Tomrin wonder. The large man looked only slightly concerned...maybe thoughtful. 
“Some tales have a bit of truth baked into them even if the facts are a jumble,” Margretta said. “But we can’t stay here paralyzed by fear…”
“I don’t think anyone is afraid,” Marten said.
“I am,” Tomrin said. “I’m afraid the glass shop is totally ruined.” 
“Because of the contract?” Marten asked. 
“No,” Tomrin said. “Because I killed Rennly.” 
“Ah,” Marten said, raising his head slightly. He nodded knowingly. “His will and testament?” 
“Yes. He said he had it changed. Now the shop will be censored. Rennly attacking me from the grave. How did you know?” 
“Well, he wanted it done quickly, so he had done it cheaply.” 
“You?” 
“Me,” Marten said with a toothy grin to rival Robles’ best. “But I wouldn’t worry.” 
“Why not?” Tomrin said in disbelief. “Tell me.” 
“Well, when you have something done cheaply, sometimes mistakes are made. I’m afraid it is for his estate to never learn certain aspects he filed with the court as they were sent to the burn bin.” 
“Freelancing again, Marten?” Margretta scolded.
Marten shrugged off her reproach. “You know me. Sometimes I make mistakes. That’s all.” 
“Yet that still doesn’t fix the money problem,” Tomrin said. 
“The three gentlemen from Woolad?” Marten mused.
Tomrin nodded, frowning. “They wanted Rennly and I to fight to fulfill the contract.” 
“I remember,” Marten said. “And now with you and Rennly gone, what are they to think?”
“Exactly. Their money won’t come through. I feel like I’ve betrayed my friends at Godly Glassworks.” 
Marten pointed into the valley. “Look, the temple is on fire and it will have to be rebuilt. And you know what that means. Your partner said to tell you that he had everything under control. And I’m not even lawyering this time. He is a good man from what I saw of him.” 
“I know what it means,” Elisah said brightly. “It means more stained glass.” 
“Yes, and who will be there to dye it?” 
“Ahh,” Tomrin said. “But the contract?”
“When there are vast sums of money to be made, men rarely stand on forms,” Margretta said. 
“Trust in human greed. I’d almost be willing to bet my knife on it.” The large triangular weapon tricked into Marten’s hand. 
“Greed does seem eternal,” Margretta added.
“I don’t know,” Tomrin said, turning away from the flames of the temple. 
“I’m not saying trust men, just their greed,” Margretta said. Marten slid home his knife. Then he and Margretta reined their horses about. Tomrin stole one last glance at Menad before nudging Misty after them. 
“I can’t believe it,” Elisah said. 
“What?” Tomrin asked her. 
“After everything, you’re worried about your glass shop.” 
“Is that so unbelievable? You saw that rock in Margretta’s hands. It was made of something like glass. We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface.” 
“It looked like a spellstone to me,” said Elisah. “You think you can make one?” 
“I’d like the chance, and who knows?” 
Tomrin contemplated as they rode on in silence. Glass and ambrosia, there seemed no limit to what he could achieve with the mastery of both. I’m well on my way. It was a pleasant thought. But he knew he had so much more to learn. Today had taught him that. He breathed in the cool night air. It was free of smoke. His weight of worry for the glass shop lifted. 
“So ultimately, this fire is good for Menad,” Elisah said. “And for your glass shop.” 
“I suppose,” Tomrin said. “But of course it all depends on how the gods take me burning down one of their temples.” 
“Maybe, but look straight ahead,” Elisah said. Tomrin took her drift to mean Marten and Magretta. “I wish I knew what was going on there,” Elisah added. 
“Margretta and Marten have their own plans,” Tomrin said. “But at least there is hope for the glass shop. For now, that is good enough for me.”🔖


Epilogue: How It Begins	
We hope to see more than the stars through the cosmic trees.
—From Notes, Digest One of the Society of Astronomers, by Head Astronomer Kurtus Jay, AC 239

Headmaster Astronomer Pario pulled his cap down over his ears to cover them. The cap was one of his mothers. She had knitted it when he was first elected to the College of Observers some forty years ago. It helped some, yet the Altar’s observatory was always cold. Carved into a rock which his gods called the Altar Mountain, the scopes were out and the platform in the cavernous observatory stood open to the mountain air. The platform required power. It was a shame sunfire could not also be used to heat it. Daughter of Heaven’s Glory used their sorcery to provide the power. It was said life on Gearthrum was different than on Serathus, but here was the only home Pario knew.
He touched his cup of coffee sitting on his desk. The ceramic cup was cold. He had drunk little of it in the excitement of finding a new Daughter so shortly after a Marked Man. The temple in a small town on the edge of the wilderness had laid out the red carpet: New Daughter Here.
Pario wanted a new cup of warm coffee, but his joints were stiff. They were feeling stiffer by the day. Send Jemmen, he thought but dismissed the idea. He didn’t want anyone to know he was starting to wear down. He’d only been headmaster for three years. His predecessor had lasted five.
Headmaster Pario stood up and hugged his heavy robes around himself before picking up the cold coffee mug. He heard the hiss of steam as one of the twenty junior astronomers shifted their scope. Scope five. Pario knew it by sound.
Pario walked over to Jemmen’s desk. They were the only two on the platform who rode desks. Everyone else rode their respective scopes, each looking tiny upon their large brass tubes. “I’m going for more coffee, Jemmen,” Pario said. “You are in charge while I’m gone.” 
“A second cup?” his assistant asked. “This late? You won’t sleep before your next shift.”
“I didn’t drink this one,” Pario replied. “The new Daughter sent coffee right out of my mind.” 
Climbing off the platform, Patio was certain Jemmen coveted his job as much as he had when Talvert was Headmaster and he was the assistant. Probably hopes I will trip and fall off the ladder and break my neck. No one was supposed to have coffee up here, but there were perks to being the Headmaster. Certain rules were forgiven. Perhaps it was an incentive, or something more sinister? Holding the coffee left him only one hand for the rails. 
“Headmaster!” Tillus called out from scope five. “It’s Menad again. It looks like a fire.” 
“Fire?” Pario shouted, stopping his descent.
“Yes, Headmaster. The whole temple seems to be on fire.” 
“That’s not possible!” The coffee cup nearly fell out of Pario’s hand. He was trembling, but not from the cold. 
“The Sisters of Mercy, Headmaster,” Jemmen called down to him. “It’s possible they—”
“Let me look!” Pario said, climbing back onto the platform.
He hurried up and over to his desk. He set down his coffee mug before rushing over to scope five’s ladder and climbed it. “I can’t believe it. An attack? That hasn’t happened in years. No. An accident maybe?” 
“An attack fits the data,” Tillus said as Pario mounted the scope and placed his eye to the piece. Pario’s heart pounded in his chest. The giant moving platform for tracking the movements of Gearthum never lied. Neither did the scopes. 
What he saw stole his breath away. The temple grounds were as they were before, only now it was dark and they were lit with a huge fire burning, gutting the temple. “Feathers,” he muttered. “Unholy feathers.” The temple wasn’t just on fire, it was gone, burnt completely up. Only the stones would remain. He pulled his eyes from the objective lens. His chest hurt. Pario wondered if this was how he died—while riding a scope, a temple burning to the ground on Gearthrun. “The data,” Pario pointed out. “Is not ours to interpret, Tillus.” But he couldn’t help shuddering. The job of bringing the news fell to him. He did not relish it. An attack. The Serath and their Daughters would be incensed. Pario himself felt incensed, giving him, an old man, more work!
He hurried down the scope, hoping he didn’t look like he was scurrying, but he had been up and down too many times. He was scurrying. The temple in Menad was burning and he was scurrying down scope five for the second time this shift. If he didn’t know better he would say scope five had it in for him, and in for his dignity. On the platform, he straightened his robe and walked over to Jemmen. 
“I need to bring the news to the sacristy; you are in charge.” 
“So it is an attack?” 
“It is a fire. I know nothing more.” 
Jemmen raised his eyebrows at Pario, but nodded. “Yes, Headmaster.”
“Blooming flowers,” Pario swore to himself and headed for the ladder of the platform. If only he had gotten off the platform with his cup of coffee faster, then delivering this bad news would have fallen to Jemmen. Then he wouldn’t be so eager to replace me. An attack did fit the data. 
A new Daughter had been found. Then the temple where she was being held was burnt to the ground. Had The Sisters of Mercy—what a cruel joke of a name—tried to capture the girl? It seemed possible. Pario had read the secret instructions first when he was assistant headmaster. It hadn’t told him much more than he suspected. Security was tight because Daughters were being kidnapped before they could be brought to Serathus and bound to the will of one of the Serath. 
Just last week the Phoenix Scope, the one used to monitor the sun, revealed that the local star had been reborn. The last time that had happened had been just before the Leviathan had broken the Gaze Between the Worlds and tossed the Window Between the Worlds into chaos. Coincidence maybe, yet Pario doubted these facts would be lost on the sacristy. 
“Please don’t let it be Seassarus still,” he prayed. Having to explain things to the red and black Serath was a trial, even the good news of the new Daughter had been met with skepticism and dismissed. The Golden Hearted was a cruel old bird even if he was one of the youngest. You are getting full of yourself, a voice in the Pario’s head told him. Thinking ill of a god.
Muscles in his arms and legs vibrated nervously as he stepped off the ladder back to the solid earth. The gods he learned had named Serathus at the beginning of their dominion—an apocryphal time. Pario did not become the Headmaster Astronomer by simply accepting the conventional wisdom. Jemmen, Pario was certain, had similar thoughts even if they never talked of them. Such thoughts could be dangerous to speak aloud.
The halls outside the cavernous observatory were lit by alcoved lamps. The lighting slowly improved with the gradual slope. The heart of the Altar Mountain hummed with the temple servants who worked and lived in the mountain and served the will of gods. The pinnacle of service was working the scopes in the observatory but at some point it seemed the servants had forgotten that. The lack of respect towards him and the other Astronomers was appalling. It was almost as if the gods and their cave dwelling helpers thought his job easy and didn’t take years upon years to master. 
Not a single person said hello as he headed for the sacristy; that was to be expected of the Serath and their Daughters, but not of the maids and porters sweeping the halls and dusting the statues of the Serath in their marble alcoves. Or of the lamp lighters and refuelers of the lamps and the hosts of cooks and launderers. Any idiot could do those jobs; only he could do his. And Jemmen of course.
Daughter Clooria still stood guard at the door to the Holy Sacristy. Behind the large wooden door bound with brass, the gods took turns before the worldstone. 
“You again, Pario.” 
“Yes, Daughter Clooria. Important news from Menad.” 
“Menad again? Haven’t you already brought the news from Menad? Going senile, Pario?” 
“It is Headmaster Astronomer Pario, Daughter Clooria, and fine minds like mine do not go senile.” 
“Then what is this other news from Menad, Headmaster Astronomer Pario? Another Daughter?”
“I can’t say, not outside the sacristy. I’m afraid it is third-level secret, Daughter.”
“No it isn’t.”
“I shouldn’t even be telling you where my report is coming from, Daughter Clooria, now please check if they will admit me?” Pario removed his knitted blue hat and stared at the yellow moon and stars his mother had sewn into it.
“Wait here,” Daughter Clooria said testily. She tapped on the door. It opened a crack and she slipped inside and the door closed. After several minutes it reopened and the woman stepped outside the sacristy. “They will see you,” she said. She didn’t seem happy about it, but she showed him inside while she stayed without. 
The inside had not changed in the intervening hours. The lamps of burnished gold still lined the walls of gray worldwood paneling. The floor too was worldwood and the carving on the walls were of Serath Prime and its worldtree—not the one on Serathus. Pario had his own theory about that. 
Seasargus and one of his Daughters, Norina, stood waiting for him. The worldstone shined with a golden light. The holy stone some claimed was a god for the gods. Others said it gave them eternal life. It was one of those mysteries Pario couldn’t quite penetrate. Anything could be the truth. Not too far from here was where the heaven hounds were kept, though he had never seen one. 
“Back again, Pario?” Seasargus’ Daughter, Norina said. “And with tales from Menad?” 
“Not tales, Daughter Norina,” Pario said, bowing before Seasargus. The god’s feathers were sharp looking and his large eyes had glossed over Pario as if he weren’t there. His black claws were as deadly looking as any Serath’s and Pario was just as happy not to have the High Lord’s attention. It was a good way to leave the room dead. “I saw with my own eyes the unthinkable. The Menad temple is burning.” 
“What part of the temple?”
“What part? The whole thing!”
“The Renegades,” Seasargus said, his feathers stirring. “They know the Phoenix Sun has been reborn? They are using it as a sign? Norina?” 
“How could they know, High Lord?” 
“How indeed, Norina?” Seasargus said, suddenly furious. “Tell me!”
“I’ll just let myself out,” Pario said quietly. 
“I don’t know,” Daughter Norina said as Pario closed the door and escaped into the hallway. 
Pario heard Seasargus roar something. It sounded like: “This is how it begins!” Then Daughter Norina screamed. Her scream cut short, Pario hurried down the hallway not saying a word to daughter Clooria, her wide eyes fixed on the door. Pario only wanted to get away, now with old Norina dead. Back in the observatory, he climbed the platform and slumped into his chair. He stared into his hands and studied the wrinkles as Jemmen walked over. 
“Nothing since you left, Headmaster. Scope five has continued its sweep.” 
Headmaster Astronomer Pario looked up. Concern lined Jemmen’s face. “You want this job, Jemmen?” Pario asked softly. 
“What happened?” 
“Daughter Norina is dead.” 
“How did she die?” 
Pario slid his coffee mug across the desk towards Jemmen. “Get me hot cup and I’ll tell you.” Jemmen picked up the mug and Pario looked down at his desk. Unfinished reports and papers for the Society of Astronomers covered it. Their work was legal on Serathus, but a deep current of heretical thought ran through the society. Members, members like himself, asked why astronomy was a taboo practice on Gearthrun? Pario pushed his unfinished letter to the society under one of his unfinished reports. The Rebirth of the Phoenix Sun, An Eyewitness Account. It was for the Society. The letter was just a condensation of the account, a summary of the juiciest bits. 
Jemmen returned with a steaming cup of coffee and set it down. He slid it forward and Pario picked it up and moved it closer to himself on the desk. “So what happened?” Jemmen said.
Pario told him everything, how he bypassed Clooria, how he found the sacristy, and how both Norina and Seasargus reacted to the news and to each other. And Clooria’s eyes. The fear. And how he had run. It was the same fear a servant might have for an angry Daughter. 
“And Seasargus?” Jemmen asked. “He said, ‘This is how it begins?’” 
“He didn’t say it so much as shouted it.” 
“What do you think it means?” 
“I don’t really know,” Pario replied. He had ideas but nothing fully explained it. 
“A new Leviathan?” Jemmen asked, keeping his voice a whisper.
“A Leviathan from Menad?” Pario asked. “Seems preposterous, doesn’t it?”
“Yet Seasargus doesn’t think so?” 
“I suppose not,” Pario said. “But maybe his outburst was shock at one of his temples burning. I don’t remember a single reference to a temple fire in the archives.” 
“I could find out?” Jemmen offered. 
“Do that,” Headmaster Astronomer Pario said. “I have a letter to write.” 
“And yes,” Jemmen said. “I would still like to be Headmaster one day.” 
“And when that day comes, Jemmen, I’m sure you’ll make a good one.” 
Jemmen padded off and Pario pulled out a fresh sheet of paper; he addressed it to the Society of Astronomers. He wrote as the platform rotated with the movements of Seruthus and Gearthrun. Pages filled with words.
Jemmen returned with a single sheet of paper in his hand. “Nothing, save for a reference in an Old High Orish book of apocrypha,” Jemmen said, handing over the sheet. On it, High Orish words were written using the standard characters. Under it was the translation. Jemmen explained an archivist helped with it. The passage was in a precise hand. 
And so shall the Lamb set fire to the Swain,
And so shall the temple come down burning. 
As was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end. 
“What book of apocrypha?”
“The archivist translated its name to something like: The Blind Crows.”
Pario put down the paper as he made a noise. “Uhh! The Lightshy Crow,” he said and looked at Jemmen. “It’s nonsense,” he said, recovering his composure. “The Lamb and the Swain. They could mean anything.” 
“I know,” Jemmen replied. “I set the man to developing a more sophisticated translation. But I don’t need to tell you that the Leviathan was touched by the demons.” 
“A second coming of the demons,” Pario said. “Maybe that is what Seasargus meant?” 
“Perhaps,” Jemmen allowed. “I’ll let you get back to work.”
Pario’s pen scratched across the sheets like lightning filling them with his thoughts and remembered facts. He painted a picture with his words for those who could not spy their local star with their scopes. He reached the end, penning his conclusions and authored a quick thanks. Then he retrieved the first sheet from the stack and turned it over to the front. All that was left was for him to title the letter. He wrote in the header. Finally he set down his pen, and reached for his coffee mug. He picked it up, but it was cold. He didn’t need coffee. He was warm and jittery from all the writing. He hadn’t written so much in one sitting before in his life. 
Jemmen came over and asked to read it. While he did, Pario watched his face as he reached certain points in the letter. When he finished, Pario asked, “What do you think?” 
“I’m not sure how the title fits in,” Jemmen said. “I mean, not without doing some research.” 
“And only then if they fully appreciate the implications of the Phoenix’s rebirth,” Patio added.
“A hidden meaning,” Jennen said. “Clever.”
“Is it?” Pario asked with a smile. “I simply thought it was a catchy title: How it Begins.” 🔖

Prologue: The Aftermath
Nothing can escape the universe, 
Not even the universe itself.
—From The Living Book of the Dead

In a panic, Seasargus flew towards the wall of smoke, dust, and death. His father had been staying in Carvel—where the first meteor had struck. Using the Knack, Seasargus climbed to where the air all but disappeared. He circled several times. Fear for his father drove him into a dive. The caustic fumes burned his lungs and he held his breath as he sailed through the worst of it. He powered earthward in a frantic state, his mind a muddle. Why? Why did his sweet Cyble have to die? She was still young. By the time he landed, his eyes burned. Tears pooled in his eyes and dripped to the still quaking earth. 
Gearthrum groaned and shuddered for the first two days he searched for his father. The stench of death filled the air and mixed with the omnipresent dust, sapping his hope of ever finding Daedalus, his father, alive. The dust smelled like ash and brimstone as rubble covered the once proud city of Carvel. Carvel was largely no more. Trees and countless human bodies lay scattered and broken in the streets. Bodies lay under broken arches, in the shattered ruins of houses, and spilled from shops.
On the third day, he finally found his father holding on by a tendril of life. A large marble column crushed his right leg, trapping him. “Seasargus,” Daedalus said weakly. “I can’t believe Jadus Terrikon did it.”
“Just hold on,” Seasargus said, unsure exactly what his father was talking about. He seemed completely out of it. “We need to get you back to Serathus and to the worldstone.” 
Seasargus quickly inspected the gash splitting his father’s forehead, possibly the reason he was talking gibberish. The gash was bad and oozed blood, but the pillar… Just looking at it crushed Seasargus’ hopes as it crushed his father’s leg. He couldn’t move it.
He pushed at it and pulled at it with his claws but his talons kept slipping off the polished marble. In his own weakened state he knew it was useless. The column would not budge. “If only Cybil were here.” She could do something, but Seasargus knew she would likely only hurt his father more with her fire and ice.
“Son?”
Seasargus stepped back and met his father’s gaze. “Father?”
“I know it’s bad,” Daedalus said. “I can see it in your eyes.”
“How could this happen?” Seasargus asked. Gearthrum’s destruction took a single day. It was a nightmare. Worse than a nightmare. The Fall of Serath Prime had taken years. All the while the worldtree had burned. This, however! This was insanity. A day. A single day!
“Jadus said he could break The Gaze Between the Worlds,” his dying father said. “I didn’t believe him. That he even had the strength… I’m sorry my son, I misjudged him.”
“What are you saying?” Seasargus asked, reeling. “You knew about this? Before? I can’t believe what I am hearing. You’re raving, Father.”
“He said he wanted to be free,” Daedalus said. “Now I suppose he is.” A tear dropped to the ground. The spot where it landed was already soaked with tears. “I suppose all are now.”
“What are you saying, Father?” Seasargus asked. There were still humans on Serathus. Surely what had happened here hadn’t happened there as well…
“The Gaze, son,” Daedalus said. “The Gaze is surely broken. Jadus freed the two worlds from the Lover’s Embrace. He said he could. I didn’t imagine he would even try.”
“Why would you allow him to talk of such things?” Seasargus said, realizing what his father meant.
“I’m sorry,” Daedalus said. “He wanted to be free. He thinks all humans should be free.”
“Look, Father,” Seasargus said, nodding to the destruction all around him. Dust and ash covered broken pillars and collapsed walls. The ceiling littered the floor. “This is what freedom looks like. There are no more humans. They are all dead. You will be dead soon too if we don’t get this pillar moved.”
“It’s too late. Too late,” his father said. His head sank to the floor. “I’ve been such a fool.”
Seasargus didn’t argue. He focused on what he could do. He needed help to move the pillar. He flew and soon realized the Gaze was indeed broken. The ground was free of its tidal lock. Worse, the Window Between the Worlds was closed, gone. It had disappeared without a trace. Seasargus flew high, into the empty space above the clouds, straight towards Serathus.
He plunged into the cold, dry ocean between the worlds. Here there was no air to breathe. Sound disappeared as the stars refused to glitter. He closed his eyes to the pain and flew by the Knack alone. He pushed all this strength and energy into speed.
He had hoped to never make this kind of journey again, save to reclaim Serath Prime back from the fires, but he feared in his weakened state his father would not survive even this short trip. 
His father was long dead when the rescue party arrived, Serath Prime’s worldstone in tow. Dead! His father was dead! Seasargus collapsed, before the stone. Its golden rays healed the damage to his own lungs and to his body from making the trip twice in such short succession.
But his nightmare was not over. “What happened to his claw?” his mother asked.
He had no idea what she meant. “The column crushed his leg,” he said.
“He’s missing a talon,” she said, pointing with her right claw.
“It has taken me two hundred and ten years to track down my father’s missing talon,” Seasargus told the High Council years later. “The Breaking is not the end of humanity’s rebellion on Gearthrum—far from it! Like rats scurrying for ready holes at a cat’s approach, drow cultists yet hide from the light. Though I lay my father to rest today, the nightmare has not ended. We are fools to think otherwise!”


Chapter 1: A Fevered Pace
Avarice is a price a wise man never pays.
	—A Orioles proverb

The sun was setting. The glass shop slept. Robles pulled Master Laz’s shop key from his pocket. He didn’t like carrying things in his pocket, not when it could go into his backpack, but he hadn’t found a place for the key yet. Lucky for him, just this evening the conundrum solved itself. The glass shop was no longer his responsibility. He’d done as he promised. He had secured the necessary funding.
Robles pushed the key into the lock. The mechanism made a satisfying clicking sound when he twisted it. Shin-nick. He twisted the key back and removed it from the keyhole before handing the key to Jergan Holerum. “The front door key,” Robles said as Jergan possessed it. “You are now the proud owner of Godly Glassworks.”
“You said you would give me the grand tour,” Jergan said when Robles turned to leave. Jergan Holerum was the son-in-law once removed from Penn Rejal. With Penn’s help he had purchased Robles’ share of the glass works. They—Robles, him, and Penn—had hammered out the details just this evening at the Blue Boar under the shadow of the Hall of Victory. Robles had paid for everything out of pocket and nearly bankrupted him, but that wasn’t why he would have preferred to host them at The Winged Helm Inn. 
The Blue Boar was stuffy and lacked the homey feel of the Helm. It also lacked its easy style of welcoming all races. Robles could tell Penn just wanted to relive his days spent at the Halls of Victory when he was a young man. The man had complained how much everything had changed. 
Jergan had simpered to the man’s every whim, but now with the old man too tired to come and see what his money had bought, it seemed Juergen expected the same from Robles. Juergen and Penn had even paid their own lawyer to write up the new contract.
“I already gave you the tour,” Robles wheedled.
“No, that was the walkthrough,” Jergan said, pulling open the door to the glass shop. “A tour means explaining the quirks of the place.”
“Right,” Robles said and stepped inside. The double doors to the back were closed. “Someone’s been here.” He pulled his knife from the sheath at his hip. The knife was balanced for throwing. After so many hours of tuning it, it was perfect and Robles felt it needed a name: Ang. The one tucked in the small of his back he called Cav.
“How do you know?” Jergan asked. “Are you sure this is the only key?”
“As far as I know,” Robles replied. “Stay behind me.”
“You good with that thing?” Jergan asked as Robles stepped to the closed door leading to the back of the shop. “I heard you won the blue ribbon at the fair.”
“Decent,” Robles replied, whispering his words. “I think I better go into the back alone. You stay out here.” 
“What if the intruder is in the office?” Jergan said.
“You’re right, you better wait outside. Lock the door behind you.”
“No way. I’m no coward,” Jergan whispered sharply. He picked up a glass rod off  Tomrin’s workstation.
Robles could see he was getting nowhere trying to appeal to the man’s own self-preservation instinct. “Then stay here and make sure no one comes through this door.”
“Right,” Jergan whispered stoutly.
Robles opened the door and nodded to Jergan. “Good man,” he said. “And remember, if someone comes through, I will be swinging blind.”
Jergan nodded back. 
Robles stepped into the darkness of the back shop and shut the door and locked it. In the back, a solo window, high in the outer wall, let in light and cast a bar of rectangular light on the far wall. Stepping inside the double doors into the kiln room, Robles shut the door and stood in the shadows. He heard nothing but the sound of crickets intruding from outside the shop. He sheathed his knife as his eyes adjusted to the light, or lack thereof, as he stepped deeper into the back room’s shadows. 
Sitting on the floor, he bowed his head. If Jergan opened the door he would see nothing of what he was about to do. His own eyes closed, Robles pushed.
His coyote spirit poured out of him. It was like a leap or falling sensation, but his pristine coyote body was born anew from inside him. Instantly he could see the kilns and the bins of raw materials as if it were noon. The benches seemed untouched. Nothing looked out of place. He sniffed the air. Tomrin! His friend’s fresh scent lingered in the air. His was the only smell out of place. The rawness of his friend worried him.  The scent was fresh, and mixed with ash and a desperate sweat. Tomrin had been here recently, and his scent laced with smoke and pain said he probably had already seen Rennly.
Robles pushed back into his body. The feeling of falling greeted him. It was like an abyss opened under him. He was falling and falling, but then he was back in his body. Raising his head, he waited several seconds then walked back to the door leading to the front. Opening it, he re-entered the front room. “No one’s here,” he told Jergan but wondered if Tomrin had a second key. “Maybe the door was closed when we left earlier? Yes?”
“I don’t remember,” Jergan said. “You weren’t doing anything back there were you?” 
Robles froze for a split second. “Like sabotage?” 
“I mean—” 
“No, just searching.”
“That’s good.” Jergan set down the glass rod. “I’m just jumpy.” 
“Think nothing of it,” Robles said, turning to the main office door. If Tomrin had come back for something it would be at his workstation or in the office. The workstation was unchanged. “Let’s start with the office, your new office, Jergan,” Robles added, slapping the man naturedly on the back. “I think you’re going to like it.”
“What if the intruder is still in there?”
“You’re right, let me go in first,” Robles said, pulling out his knife and playing along. He opened the door to Master Laz’s office and slipped inside. A sheet of paper which hadn’t been there before now sat on the desk. The light was strong here as the sun entered the side window. 
Robles picked up the letter and read it by the splash of orange on the wall. “Tomrin is leaving the glass shop!” he called out and opened the door. 
Jergan stared at him. “What is it?” Jergan asked, looking at the letter. 
“Someone was here: Tomrin Watersipper. He left this note,” Robles said. “Your concerns of not being able to work with him are taken care of. He wrote saying he is leaving the shop.”
“Leaving?”
“Yes. That means his percentage reverts to the shop,” Robles said, wondering if he still had time to go tell his friend that his fight with Rennly wasn’t needed. He could probably also fix the blunder of losing all of his stock.
“Just like that?” the man asked.
“That was the agreement. If any of us left, our share of the profit returned to the shop,” Robles explained. “Too bad for him he didn’t sell his first.”
“Well, that’s great news,” Jergan said. “My uncle will be very happy to hear it.”
“I’m sure he will,” Robles said. “I really must be going.” He headed towards the front door, before Jergan could realize that his leaving meant the grand tour was over before it had started. Robles opened the door but turned back before he stepped out of the shop for the last time. “Tomrin entered through the back door. You have to lift the handle to hear the latch. Then it is fully locked.”
“What about the tour?” 
“That’s the only quirk of the place that I know,” Robles replied. “And I didn’t even remember that, Tomrin did.” He stepped outside and shut the door gently, but firmly behind him.
The night’s gloom engulfed him and Menad as he hurried up the street towards the Winged Helm Inn. Something had happened to make Tomrin want to leave Godly Glassworks. It made no sense. Glass was his friend’s life and here he was giving it up on what seemed a whim. Writing it down on a note didn’t seem like him at all. Tomrin had always been a touch strange, a touch too high strung, a touch unstable. But this was out of the ordinary, even for him. 
At the Eastern Highway, Robles turned and headed into Menad proper. He loped down the street at an easy pace, one most others would find unsafe at this incline, but he made it look easy, natural. No one would think anything of it, or of him.
A flame from the temple licked the horizon. The spire belched flames and the balcony was burning. “Feathers,” Robles swore to himself. He hadn’t even looked. That wasn’t like him. Usually he saw everything. When he arrived at the temple grounds a crowd of people had already formed. He skirted them as fire bells rang in the distance.
There was no time to waste suiting up. If his friend was trapped inside he needed in as fast as humanly possible. He ran along the bushes to the first side door. “Locked!” He hurried around and he heard a sound like he’d never heard before. Skrootch! The sound set the hair on his neck on end. Someone was using magic or a new weapon. That or an old weapon had finally exploded inside the temple.
Robles scrambled behind the bushes as an Adaman woman and the lawyer from the festival rushed towards the epicenter of the explosion. Laying flat Robles pushed out into his coyote spirit. This was a terrible place to be caught out but he needed to see and to hear what was going on. 
Tomrin was with a young woman of Oriole extraction. Robles remembered her thought he had only seen her twice before, once at the Winged Helm and once at the courthouse. She hadn’t even noticed him then, a common mistake many Orioles made when he wished to fit in with everyone. In the courthouse, Tomrin had been the man of the hour and Robles could hardly blame her. 
The Orish counselor, like a parent protecting a child, wrapped his cloak around her. The man’s eyes roved and Robles shut his own, hoping he wasn’t spied by the vigilant giant. The girl seemed dazed, her distress evident in her pinched voice as she questioned the Adaman woman who touched Tomrin on the shoulders.
Robles slunk down on his belly pushing his paws out soundlessly on the dirt and dried bark mulch—the closer to the ground the more hidden he was. First the girl and Marten tracked past, then Tomrin and the woman.
When the sound of their feet receded, Robles pushed back into his body. He was unsure what he witnessed despite always knowing what was going on. I’m the one who plans it! Crouching and keeping to the bushes, he turned around and followed Marten and his charge. He ditched his backpack in a hidden spot. It was too distinctive to hide in the crowd.
He kept his head bowed as he joined the crowd out front of the temple. He muttered in a confused tongue like a beggar, and asked the gods for mercy and protection like several others as he kept his head down. His eyes searched for Tomrin. They had to come this way. Feathers, he swore to himself. “The gods save us,” he said dumbly. The poor and ignorant needed gods to tell them what they should do. Without them there was no telling what trouble they would get into. 
A firetruck pushed through the crowd, its bell ringing like mad. Robles worried the counselor and the girl had gone a different way. Tomrin and the woman, however, were nearly run over by it as it pushed through the crowd. Tomrin wears a nightshirt now? What have you gotten yourself into, Tomrin? 
Robles slunk back to where he’d dropped his pack. Once he picked it up and put it on, he could no longer hide as easily. He trotted out into the crowd, keeping an easy gait; the eyes on him seemed to give him energy; and he walked directly toward the fire marshall.
“Fire Marshall Tamerton. You’ve netted a big one today.”
“Robles! You are here,” the man replied. “What do you make of it?”
“Let the gods sort this one out,” Robles said as glass shattered in the temple. “It’s already chimneyed. I’m not sure Daughters could stop it now.” After a few more pleasantries and hellos to the old crew—the Jaker brothers still going strong—Robles slid back into the crowd. 
Heading for the courthouse stables, Tomrin was clearly going somewhere with his new friends. Robles aimed to find out where. He hoped for Corundum. He had always wanted to go to the capital. His friend was up to something. Robles didn’t know what, but Tomrin had clearly run into some trouble with his fight with Rennly. Holy trouble.
The Grover Bakeshop and its steps were three streets from the stables. Robles crawled under the steps after checking no one was looking. He positioned his body. There was just enough room for him and his animal spirit. 
He pushed and entered his coyote form. His paws stirred the rotting leaves under him. From the bakery—today had been pumpernickel day—the smell of rye filtered down to him.
Pitch black when he entered the small alcove under the step, the light, even in the starshade, was plenty for his yellow eyes to see himself sleeping—or whatever it was his body did while he was in his coyote skin. It was similar to looking at himself in a mirror. He had long since lost any sense of unbalance which came with seeing himself lying, sitting, or curled up like he was now. 
He padded out into the shadows of the eaves and trotted from pool of dark to pool of dark, sniffing the air as he went. Tomrin’s scent was sour and bitter. His musk was as strong as any man’s. If he smelled like himself before, he smelled ten times more like himself now. What is he up to? Robles wondered as he headed back towards the courthouse stables. I’ll know soon enough, he assured himself. When he set himself to finding out things he always did.
As he approached, the stables smelled of horses Tomrin’s odor and the others’ grew stronger. This was, as he expected, where they meant to meet up. Two men, two women, and only three horses? 
Someone had doubled up. But why? The mystery was deepening, but he knew at least which way they were going—east at first estimation. Then north? Robles paused in his pursuit. The lawyer was trying to avoid tails. He was a worthy adversary. 
Suddenly the large Orish man’s head swiveled. Robles felt a chill. His reddish coyote hair stood on end. The man had been watchfull up until then, but now it was as if he could see in the dark. What the man saw made him frown. He saw me? Robles could hardly believe it. Who was this man? What power did he have over Tomrin? Questions flooded throughout Robles’ head as he froze in the shadows.
The man turned again and Robles changed his strategy. I’ll pick them back up, he told himself as he headed up an alley and ran parallel to the horses as they trotted two streets over. He avoided starlight and only ran in the shadows. 
Suddenly the sound of the horses vanished from the night air. Feathers! Where did they go? Robles turned back down his current alley, then turned to sneak a peek around the side of the corner house. He knew the owner, the tailor. He was a supporter of the deposed king. The man would probably die on the spot if he knew a blood beast was outside.
The party of desperate riders—they looked desperate—waited and watched. The girl clung to Tomrin as if he were her only hope to live. They spoke in muted tones. The lawyer spoke so low Robles had to turn his head to hear what he said. “...being followed…” the man said. “...a coyote…” That provoked dissenting opinions but the feathered man was right. He did see you, Robles accused himself. He couldn’t believe it. He had been all but invisible, yet this lawyer had seen right through the darkness. How? It was clearly possible, but feathers! The man was good.
The riders moved off. Robles chased, but from a greater distance now. He had been careless. He didn’t really need to see them to track them. The scent of horses hung in the air like a savory perfume, so strong he had to remind himself eating them wasn’t the ultimate goal here, even if of all the animals—deer, elk, goats, sheep, oxen and the host of other smaller animals he’d eaten—horse was the sweetest.
The dirt, dust, and dried soil beneath his feet held the warmth of day. The land was dying. The winter drought lingered now into spring. Serathus with its blue crystal ocean and milky white storms rose in the east. The gods could keep Serathus alive but it seemed completely left to men to keep Gearthrum from turning into one large ball of dust.
As he tracked the riders west to the highway as it led out of Menad, Robles stuck to lawns, alleys, and untended strips of land unimproved by human hands. Scrawny mice, rats, and ground birds fled from him. He could smell them, but he moved not to hunt them, rather to circle ahead of Tomrin and his strange party. He hadn’t taken an exact path, but he knew the land and where he entered the wooded area with its water-starved pines.
Here the road tracked north along the valley lip. The riders stopped again. Robles was not surprised by where. He moved carefully towards them. Here was the last good place to look back into the valley. It was the last place for goodbyes before the long stretch to Conundrum. When Robles heard Tomrin mention the glass shop he wanted to be able to tell him it was all neatly taken care of but he couldn’t speak as a coyote. Then the party was moving again. 
Who is this man? Robles wondered of the lawyer as he chased the riders from the woods.  He continued to shadow them, trying to catch snatches of conversation, trying to glean more of what he could of their intentions but largely they were silent as their horses plodded along under them. The needles under Robles’ paws were dry and reddish gray in the shadows of the pines. But he thinks I’m a good man. Robles smiled to himself. Even if the lawyer was some sort of Lightshy Crow, Robles decided he liked the man.
He stepped lightly to avoid making a noise, but with his luck this Orish counselor could also hear the tears of a mouse hitting dry earth. Robles could as a blood beast, if close enough, but there was no telling what this man could do. His powers of observation were near preternatural—if that was all it was. He’s just a man, Robles reminded himself. 
And yet the more he tried to riddle-free the party’s flight from Menad the more he was certain Marten could spelldance. Poor Rennly. The half-boy had come to a bad end. The woman who wasn’t really Robles’ aunt usually saw the truth of things. She had been the first to call him a half-boy, a moniker they kept to themselves.
The scent of perfume ahead caught Robles off guard. Women were just ahead, just beyond a coming bend in the road. Dashing ahead Robles found the source: three women—one he recognized—and two censors. They blocked a narrowing in the road. Their horses stood behind them. All three of the women were dressed in silk. The black clad men looked bored. They had the look of men who had been standing about for several hours, their interest in what they were doing long waned. They and the women were spread out across the road. Ambush!
Robles forced himself to think. He had to find a way to warn Tomrin. Not having a good way made him howl. Tomrin and the others weren’t coyotes, but he howled anyway. Cahroo! Had they been coyotes, Robles was sure they would turn and flee.
The men and women on the road glanced towards him. One of them yelped. The other man teased him. “You think a crow can turn into a wolf, Jim?”
Robles scoffed into his paws. Wolf? Ha!
“It only startled me is all. I’m tired of chasing phantoms all day.”
“Quiet you two, he will hear us.” The woman Robles recognized. “We aren’t chasing anyone.”
“You don’t even know they’re coming, Calena,” the shorter of the silk-clad women said. “We should head back. We all felt him cast in the city. What are we doing out here?”
“We’re out-foxing the fox,” Calena replied. “He can’t be working alone.”
So that was it? Marten was Marked. Maybe magic is how he saw me? That didn’t seem outside the realm of possibilities. Last week alone, Robles had seen the spirit of his dead friend, Gaz, returned to some semblance of life, then returned to his dead body by Calena. I need to do something, Robles thought, but already Tomrin and the other riders approached. 
He had magic, but with his body so back in Menad he couldn’t speak. It also meant he couldn’t do repeated sneak attacks, a style of fighting he had perfected. You don’t even know who to attack, he lamented. It was a worrying proposition. Martin could cast. He would have to be the first target. How did you get mixed up with such a man, Tomrin? 
Robles felt he knew the answer: the fair and the courthouse. Clearly something had happened. Something bad. The girl though? Robles had known of her from an old coworker, Danwa Istalla, even before seeing her. Still nothing made any sense! The solid clop, clop of hooves on the dry road filled his ears. His friend was just around the bend in the road. The Daughters and censors straightened at the sound of horses. 
Robles wanted to howl again, but instead closed his eyes. His mind raced at a fevered pace.
